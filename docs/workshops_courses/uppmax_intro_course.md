# Introduction to UPPMAX and Linux

## Overview and Schedule

UPPMAX application experts want to share their skills in a 3-day series of lectures. We will help you move from being a Linux novice to an UPPMAX expert. If you already have the fundamentals down, you are still sure to enjoy the tips and tricks in the later parts of the course. Hence we've made it possible to sign up only for the days that are interesting to you.

When: February 10-12, 2025.

Where: online via Zoom.
