This course helps you get started with Python,
by working through an online and free book.
We make use of the UPPMAX HPC cluster
to write and run Python code.
The pace of this highly interactive course
is set by the majority of learners,
ensuring that any complete beginner
has enough time for exercises.
At the end of the day, you should feel comfortable with the basics
of Python and feel familiar to a book on Python to help you on your next steps.

You will:

- Feel comfortable with learning Python
- Feel comfortable using an online and free book on Python
- Write Python code on an HPC cluster
- Run Python scripts on an HPC cluster

Before the course, you must have:

- A user account on a Swedish academic HPC cluster

???- question "How can I check if I have this?"

    When you can login at [https://supr.naiss.se/](https://supr.naiss.se/).

    It should look similar to this:

???- question "How to get this?"

    Register at [https://supr.naiss.se/person/register/](https://supr.naiss.se/person/register/).

???- question "What if I have a problem here?"

- Be able to login to an HPC cluster using SSH

???- question "How can I check if I have this?"

    This depends on the HPC cluster you are using.
    For UPPMAX's Rackham, it look similar to this:
