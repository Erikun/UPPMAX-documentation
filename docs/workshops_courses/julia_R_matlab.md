# Introduction to running Julia, R, and Matlab in HPC

Learn how to run Julia, R, and Matlab at Swedish HPC centres. We will show you how to find and load the needed modules, how to write a batch script, as well as how to install and use your own packages, and more.
The course will consist of lectures interspersed with hands-on sessions where you get to try out what you have just learned.

We will mainly use Tetralith at NSC for the examples for the course, but there is little difference in how you use the various HPC centres in Sweden and you should have no problems applying the knowledge to the other systems.

This course will consist of three days (9:00-16:00), one for each language. It is a cooperation between HPC2N, LUNARC, and UPPMAX. 

Dates: 24-26 March 2025.
