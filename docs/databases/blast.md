# Blast databases available locally

Many pipelines involving annotation/assembly comparison involve Blast. Several Blast versions are available as modules, for example:

    blast/2.12.0+, etc. : the Blast+ suites (blastp, tblastn, etc.), recommended
    diamond/2.0.14 : the DIAMOND protein aligner, recommended for protein databases. See UPPMAX's DIAMOND database webpage for more information.
    blast/2.2.26, etc. : 'legacy' Blast (blastall, megablast, etc)

Use module spider blast to see available versions. As for all bioinformatics tools at Uppmax, module load bioinfo-tools is required before the blast modules are available.

Uppmax maintains local copies of many Blast databases, including many available at NCBI:

    ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/README
    ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/documents/blastdb.html
    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK62345/

    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/refseq_select/
    https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/smartblast/smartBlast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs#searchSets

as well as several UniProt databases.

Note that:

    The local UPPMAX copies are found at /sw/data/blast_databases
    Doing module load blast_databases sets the environment variable BLASTDB to this directory; this is loaded as a prerequisite when loading any blast modules
    New versions are installed the first day of each month at 00.01 from local copies updated the 28th of the previous month beginning at 00.01
    When new versions are installed, the directory containing the previous versions is renamed to blast_databases_old
    blast_databases_old is deleted the second data of each month at 00.01

These databases use the "v5" format, which includes rich taxonomic information with sequences, and will only work with the Blast tools from the module blast/2.8.0+ and later. Earlier module versions can still be used, but you will need to provide/build your own databases. NCBI no longer updates databases with the older "v4" databases as of February 2020, and they have been deleted from UPPMAX. The final updates of these databases (again, as of this writing nearly two years old) are available from NCBI over FTP at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/v4.

Each NCBI-hosted database also includes a JSON file containing additional metadata for that particular database. These are found in /sw/data/blast_databases/ and are named databasename*.json. The exact name varies based on the format of the database. For example, the contents of the JSON file for the nr database can be see by running

cat /sw/data/blast_databases/nr*.json

Additionally, taxdb.btd and taxdb.bti are downloaded, which provide additional taxonomy information for these databases. Local copies of the NCBI Taxonomy databases are also available; further details are available on a separate page.

For UniVec and UniVec_Core, Fasta-format files containing the vector sequences are also available with the given names (e.g., /sw/data/uppnex/blast_databases/UniVec), alongside the Blast-format databases built from the same Fasta files.

The exact times all databases were updated are provided by database.timestamp files located in the directory
Databases are available automatically after loading any blast module

When any of the blast modules is loaded, the BLASTDB environment variable is set to the location of the local database copies (/sw/data/uppnex/blast_databases). The various Blast tools can use this variable to find the locations of databases, so that only the name needs to be specified.

module load bioinfo-tools blast/2.7.1+
blastp -db nr -query input.fasta

After loading the blast/2.7.1+ module, specifying blastp -db nr results in blastp searching the local copy of nr, because the BLASTDB environment variable is set when the module is loaded. Similarly, each of these would result in searching the local copy of the given database:

blastp -db pdbaa ...
blastp -db uniprot_sprot ...
blastp -db uniprot_uniref90 ...
blastn -db nt ...
blastn -db refseq_genomic ...

WGS and SRA sequence databases are not included

The NCBI Whole-Genome Shotgun is not available locally. NCBI provides special versions of Blast and other tools that can be used to search the remote versions of WGS and the Sequence Read Archive.

These special blast versions and other tools are part of NCBI's SRA Tools, which is available at Uppmax as the sratools module. We have also include auxiliary NCBI scripts in the sratools module to convert taxonomic IDs to WGS and SRA identifiers.

Note that NCBI's TSA database is available at UPPMAX, just use the database name tsa_nr or tsa_nt.
