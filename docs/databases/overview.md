# Overview of databases

Many commonly used data sources are stored locally at UPPMAX. This page provides an index to pages where they are described in more detail.
Available databases:

- [BLAST databases available locally](../databases/blast.md)
- [NCBI taxonomy databases](databases/ncbi.md)
- [DIAMOND protein alignment databases](databases/diamond.md)
- [Reference genomes](databases/reference_genomes.md)
- [1000-genome project](databases/1000-genome_project.md)
- [Simons Genome Diversity Project datasets](databases/simons_genome.md)
- [Other bioinformatics-oriented local data resources](databases/other_local.md)

In order for you to access **Swegen** or **1000-genomes** you must first send an email to datacentre@scilifelab.se and ask for access. When they approve you, they will contact UPPMAX and we will grant access to Swegen.
