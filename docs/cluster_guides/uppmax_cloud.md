# UPPMAX cloud

Cloud services allow a user to have something active (typically a website)
that can be accessed by the internet.

The [NAISS 'Swedish Science Cloud (SSC)'](https://www.naiss.se/resource/swedish-science-cloud-ssc/),
consists out of multiple regions.
The eastern region (called `EAST-1`) of SCC is named
'Dis' (the Swedish word for 'haze')
and is hosted by Uppsala
university (the service is called 'UPPMAX cloud')
and Ume√• University (north, HPC2N).

## History of Dis

The UPPMAX cloud 'Dis' (Swedish word for 'haze')
and successor of 'Smog' (Swedish for 'smog')
was introduced in October 2017 and upgraded during 2020.
