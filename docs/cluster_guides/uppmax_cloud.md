# UPPMAX cloud

Cloud services allow a user to have something active (typically a website)
that can be accessed by the internet.

For this, the UPPMAX cloud
has a service called 'Dis' (the Swedish word for 'haze').
'Dis' is part of the `EAST-1` region of the SNIC science cloud.


## Dis

The UPPMAX cloud 'Dis' (Swedish word for 'haze')
and successor of 'Smog' (Swedish for 'smog')
was introduced in October 2017 and upgraded during 2020.

The [NAISS 'Swedish Science Cloud (SSC)'](https://www.naiss.se/resource/swedish-science-cloud-ssc/),
consists out of multiple regions.
Dis is the eastern region of the NAISS SSC
and is hosted together with Ume√• University (north, HPC2N).

## Apply

Researchers interested in applying for a Swedish Science Cloud project should
[request a project in NAISS SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se/resource/cloud-ssc/)

## Technical data

- 40 compute nodes, 24 dedicated for NAISS and 16 for local projects.
  Each compute node is equipped with 128-256GB memory
  and dual CPU E5-2660 at 2.2GHz for a total of 16 cores per compute node
- VM flavors for small (2 vCPUs) up to large (16 vCPUs) compute allocations
- 250 TB of total volume storage.
- Interconnect is 10GbE.

Object storage is planned for 2021 but currently unavailable.
