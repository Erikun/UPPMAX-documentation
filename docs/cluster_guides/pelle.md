- [Pelle's name](pelles_name.md)

Pelle is an upcoming general-purpose UPPMAX cluster,
paid by Uppsala University.

Uppsala users of [Rackham](rackham.md) will be moved to Pelle
by UPPMAX after [applying to a Pelle project](../getting_started/project_apply_pelle.md).

Non-Uppsala users of [Rackham](rackham.md) can move their data to
Dardel, see [the Rackham to Dardel migration guide](../cluster_guides/dardel_migration.md).

???- question "Why use Pelle over another NAISS system?"

    Here is a table of why you want to use Pelle over another NAISS
    HPC cluster.

    Parameter|Tetralith|Pelle
    Max job time|10 days|Longer


???- question "What is the status of Pelle?"

    See [the Pelle status page](https://status.uppmax.uu.se/2025-04-09/pelle/)

    **Pelle is now open for all users for testing. Welcome!**

    Let us know if you are missing your favorite tools. We'll install those on demand.

## Migration from Rackham to Pelle

As both clusters are UPPMAX clusters,
we will transfer your data from [Rackham](rackham.md)
to Pelle. Users will have to [apply to a Pelle project](../getting_started/project_apply_pelle.md).

## Pelle hardware

[Pelle/Maja hardware](../hardware/clusters/pelle.md)

## Information for test pilots

We have a separate page with [information for Pelle test pilot users](./pelle_test.md)
