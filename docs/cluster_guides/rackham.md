# Rackham

Rackham is one of the [UPPMAX clusters](uppmax_cluster.md).

!!! info "Consider migrating to Dardel already"

    The Rackham cluster will be decommissioned at the end of 2024 so all 
    projects have to migrate their data and calculations to other resources. 
    The plan from NAISS is that all Rackham users will move to the Dardel cluster at PDC.

    See the page on file transfer to Dardel [here](transfer_dardel.md).

Here we describe [Rackham's name](#rackham's-name)
and [Rackham's design](#rackham's-design).

## Rackham's name

Rackham, like all [UPPMAX clusters](uppmax_cluster.md), 
is named after a Tintin character,
in this case after Red Rackham.

???- question "What are the UPPMAX clusters?"

    All UPPMAX clusters can be found [here](uppmax_cluster.md).

## Rackham's design

Rackham is an (general-purpose) high-performance computing (HPC) cluster.

???- question "What is an HPC cluster?"

    What an HPC cluster is, is described [here](uppmax_cluster.md).

Or: Rackham is a group of computers that can effectively run many calculations, 
as requested by multiple people, at the same time.
Rackham runs the Linux operating system and all users need some
basic Linux knowledge to use Rackham.

???- tip "Using Linux"

    Using Linux (and especially the so-called command-line/terminal) is essential
    to use Rackham. Learning the essential Linux commands 
    is described [here](../getting_started/linux.md).
