# Slurm troubleshooting

When using [Slurm](slurm.md), unexpected things may happen.
This page describes Slurm errors.

## Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

### Full error message

```text
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
```

### To reproduce

```bash
touch do_something.sh
echo '#!/bin/bash' >> do_something.sh 
sbatch -A some_invalid_account do_something.sh 
```

### Problem

As stated by the error message: you've used either:

- an invalid account (for example, `some_invalid_account` in the example above)
- an invalid combination of account and partition,
  for example using a Rackham account for a Snowy partition

Or, in less formal terms, you are using a NAISS project that is not
an active UPPMAX project for that UPPMAX cluster.

### Solution

- [View your NAISS projects](https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/getting_started/project/#view-your-uppmax-projects)
  and see if the project you used is indeed an active UPPMAX project that can
  be used on the cluster you expect
- Use these in your scripts
