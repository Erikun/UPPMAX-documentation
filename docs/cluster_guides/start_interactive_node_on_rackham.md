# Starting an interactive node on Rackham

![Log in to Bianca via a terminal](./img/login_bianca_via_terminal_terminal_462_x_202.png)

This page describes how to start an interactive node on [Rackham](rackham.md),
unlike the [general information on starting an interactive node](start_interactive_node.md).

To use an interactive node, in a terminal, type:

```bash
interactive -A [project name]
```

For example:

```bash
interactive -A uppmax2023-2-25
```

This starts an interactive session using project `uppmax2023-2-25`
that has a default duration of 1 hours.

???- tip "Forgot your Rackham project?"

    One can go to the SUPR NAISS pages to see one's projects,

    > Example of the Rackham project called 'UPPMAX 2023/2-25'

    On the SUPR NAISS pages, projects are called 'UPPMAX [year]/[month]-[day]',
    for example, 'UPPMAX 2023/2-25'.
    The UPPMAX project name, as to be used on Rackham,
    has a slightly different name:
    the account name to use on Rackham is `uppmax[year]-[month]-[day]`,
    for example, `uppmax2023-2-25`

To increase the duration of the interactive session,
add the use of `-t`:

```bash
interactive -A [project name] -t [session_duration]
```

For example:

```bash
interactive -A uppmax2023-2-25 -t 8:00:00
```

This starts an interactive session using project `uppmax2023-2-25`
that has a maximum duration of 8 hours.

!!! note "Has Rackham frozen?"

    It can take tens of seconds before an interactive node is allocated.

    Rackham has not frozen, just be a bit more patient.
