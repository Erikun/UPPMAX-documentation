# Cluster speeds

Sometimes you feel a cluster is slow.

Below are some benchmark results, so you can compare with what you are
experiencing.

Please [contact support](support.md) when you find out that your favorite
cluster is slower than expected.

???- question "What could cause such a slowdown?"


    > When things are slow it is usually due to latency
    > when many processes are accessing the same files
    > and physical hard drives

    Examples:

    - 2024-12-06: Castor is still holding some file systems for Bianca
      or a user that is running a lot of very short lived Perl jobs on Bianca,
      that are running too hard on Castor.
