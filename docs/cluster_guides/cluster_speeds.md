# Cluster speeds

Sometimes you feel a cluster is slow.

Below are some benchmark results, so you can compare with what you are
experiencing.

Please [contact support](support.md) when you find out that your favorite
cluster is slower than expected.

???- question "What could cause such a slowdown?"


    > When things are slow it is usually due to latency
    > when many processes are accessing the same files
    > and physical hard drives

    Examples:

    - 2024-12-06: Castor is still holding some file systems for Bianca
      or a user that is running a lot of very short lived Perl jobs on Bianca,
      that are running too hard on Castor.

## Starting an interactive node

In general:

- It takes seconds if a free compute node is available
- It takes minutes to start a new node

### `interactive -A sens2017625 -n 2 -t 1:00:00`

???- question "What was the system usage at the time of these measurements?"

    Bianca used around 800 out of around 3200 cores.

???- question "What was the project CPU usage at the time of these measurements?"

    CPU usage was close to zero:

## Loading the `R_packages/4.3.1` module

For [a benchmark to solve a ticket](https://github.com/UPPMAX/ticket_304069/blob/master/module_load.md#answers),
the following command was run in multiple settings:

```bash
time module load R_packages/4.3.1
```

From the three resulting times, the 'Real' time is used.

Here are some expected timings:
