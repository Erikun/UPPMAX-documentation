# Working with environment modules on Bianca

Bianca is shared Linux computer with all the standard Linux tools installed,
on which all users should be able to
do their work independently and undisturbed.

Because this is the same for nearly all UPPMAX clusters,
there is a general page on modules [here](modules.md)
