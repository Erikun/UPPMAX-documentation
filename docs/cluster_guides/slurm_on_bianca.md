???- question "What is Slurm?"

    See the general page on Slurm [here](slurm.md)

    See the general page on Bianca [here](bianca.md)

See [Slurm troubleshooting](slurm_troubleshooting.md)
how to fix Slurm errors.

## `sbatch` (and `interactive`) on Bianca

`sbatch` (and `interactive`) work the same as on [Rackham](rackham.md).

???- question "Want to start an interactive job?"

    See how to start an interactive job on Bianca [here](start_interactive_job_on_bianca.md)

Here it is shown how to submit a job with:

- command-line Slurm parameters
- Slurm parameters in the script

## `sbatch` a script with command-line Slurm parameters

The minimal command to use `sbatch` with command-line Slurm parameters is:

``` bash
sbatch -A [project_code] [script_filename]
```

where `[project_code]` is the project code, and `[script_filename]`
the name of a bash script, for example:

``` bash
sbatch -A sens2017625 my_script.sh
```

???- question "Forgot your Bianca project?"

    When [login to Bianca's remote desktop environment](../getting_started/login_bianca.md)
    webpage at [https://bianca.uppmax.uu.se](https://bianca.uppmax.uu.se) is
    helpful in showing you your Bianca projects:

???- question "What is in the script file?"

    The script file `my_script.sh` is a minimal example script.
    Such a minimal example script could be:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Hello"
    ```

Again, what is shown here is a minimal use of `sbatch`.
See the general page on Slurm [here](slurm.md).

## `sbatch` a script with Slurm parameters in script

The minimal command to use `sbatch` with Slurm parameters in the script:

``` bash
sbatch [script_filename]
```

where `[script_filename]` the name of a bash script, for example:

``` bash
sbatch my_script.sh
```

The script must contain at least the following lines:

```
#SBATCH -A [project_code]
```

where `[project_code]` is the project code, for example:

```bash
#SBATCH -A sens2017625
```
