![Working with a computer cluster module system](./img/627409_working_with_a_computer_cluster_module_system_256_x_256.png)

Rackham is shared Linux computer with all the standard Linux tools installed,
on which all users should be able to
do their work independently and undisturbed.

Because this is the same for nearly all UPPMAX clusters,
see [the UPPMAX general page on modules](modules.md).
