# UPPMAX history

* On January 12, 2024, the Irham nodes `r[1001-1072,1179-1250]`
   have been decommissioned. In 2021, the NGI HPC system Irma was replaced
   by Miarka, freeing up Irma nodes.
   In later part of 2021 a research group expressed interest in
   integrating Irma nodes into Rackham and provided the necessary
   funding until 2024. The compute node extension
   became `r[1001-1072,1179-1250]` and was integrated in Rackham in 2022
   and informally received the nickname Irham.
