# Pelle's name

[Pelle](pelle.md), starts a new tradition to name the clusters after the fiction characters
in the children's book [Pelle Svanslös](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelle_Svansl%C3%B6s)
in this case after Pelle Svanslös himself. 

The upcoming [Maja](maja.md) cluster for sensitive data is also named after a character from here.
