Welcome to the Snowy portal!

Here you will find all information related to UPPMAX's Snowy HPC cluster.

- [Snowy's name and design](snowy.md)
- [Log in](../getting_started/login_snowy.md)
- [Submitting jobs, using Slurm](slurm.md)
- [Workshops and courses](../workshops_courses/workshops_courses.md)

## Accounts and log in

Snowy is different from other clusters at UPPMAX in that 
there are no login nodes for Snowy. 
All access to this system is done via secure shell (a.k.a [SSH](../software/ssh.md)) interactive login to the login node, using the domain name **rackham.uppmax.uu.se**

> `ssh -AX user@rackham.uppmax.uu.se`

To get a user account and start using UPPMAX, see the [Getting Started](http://uppmax.uu.se/support/getting-started/) page.

For questions concerning accounts and access to Rackham and Snowy, please contact [UPPMAX support](mailto:support@uppmax.uu.se).

Note that the machine you arrive at when logged in is only a so called login node, where you can do various smaller tasks. We have [some limits](http://uppmax.uu.se/support/user-guides/login-node-restrictions/) in place that restricts your usage. For larger tasks you should use our batch system that pushes your jobs onto other machines within the cluster.

All access to Snowy is done using the batch system Slurm, either as an interactive job or non-interactive batch jobs.

## Using the batch system

To allow a fair and efficient usage of the system we use a resource manager to coordinate user demands. On Snowy we use the [Slurm](http://slurm.schedmd.com) resource manager. Read our [Slurm user guide](http://uppmax.uu.se/support/user-guides/slurm-user-guide/) for detailed information on how to use Slurm.

**Note:** When accessing snowy from Rackhams login nodes you must always use the flag -M for all Slurm commands.  
Examples:

*   squeue -M snowy
*   jobinfo -M snowy
*   sbatch -M snowy slurm\_script\_file
*   scancel -u username -M snowy
*   interactive -A projectname -M snowy -p node -n 32 -t 01:00:00

**Note:** We always recommend loading all your modules in your job script file, This is even more important when running on Snowy since the module environment is not the same on the Rackham login nodes as on Snowy compute nodes.

### Some Limits

*   There is a job walltime limit of 30 days (720 hours).
*   We restrict each user to at most 5000 running and waiting jobs in total.
*   Each project has a 30 days running allocation of CPU hours. We do not forbid running jobs after the allocation is overdrafted, but instead allow to submit jobs with a very low queue priority, so that you may be able to run your jobs anyway, if a sufficient number of nodes happens to be free on the system.
*   Very wide jobs will only be started within a maintenance window (just before the maintenance window or at the end of the maintenance window). These are planned for the first Wednesday of each month. On Snowy a "very wide" job asks for 100 nodes or more.

### Convenience Variables

*   **$SNIC\_TMP - Path to node-local temporary disk space**
      
    The **$SNIC\_TMP** variable contains the path to a node-local temporary file directory that you can use when running your jobs, in order to get maximum disk performance (since the disks are local to the current compute node). This directory will be automatically created on your (first) compute node before the job starts and automatically deleted when the job has finished.
      
    The path specified in **$SNIC\_TMP** is equal to the path: /**scratch/$SLURM\_JOB\_ID**, where the job variable **$SLURM\_JOB\_ID** contains the unique job identifier of your job.
      
    **WARNING:** Please note, that in your "core" (see below) jobs, if you write data in the **/scratch** directory but outside of the /**scratch/$SLURM\_JOB\_ID** directory, your data may be automatically deleted during your job run.

### Details about the "core" and "node" partitions

A normal Snowy node contains 128 GB of RAM and 16 compute cores. An equal share of RAM for each core would mean that each core gets at most 8 GB of RAM. This simple calculation gives one of the limits mentioned below for a "core" job.

You need to choose between running a "**core**" job or a "**node**" job. A "core" job must keep within certain limits, to be able to run together with up to 19 other "core" jobs on a shared node. A job that cannot keep within those limits must run as a "node" job.

Some serial jobs must run as "**node**" jobs. You tell Slurm that you need a "node" job with the flag "-p node". (If you forget to tell Slurm, you are by default choosing to run a "core" job.)

A "**core**" job:

*   Will use a part of the resources on a node, from a 1/16 share to a 15/16 share of a node.
    
*   Must specify less cores than 16, i.e.between "**\-n 1**" to "**\-n 15**".
    

*   Must not demand "-N", "--nodes", or "--exclusive".
    
*   Is recommended not to demand "--mem"
    

*   Must not demand to run on a fat node (see below, for an explanation of "fat"), a devel node.
    

*   Must not use more than 8 GB of RAM for each core it demands. If a job needs half of the RAM, i.e. 64 GB, you need to reserve also at least half of the cores on the node, i.e. 8 cores, with the "-n 8" flag.
    

A "**core**" job is accounted on your project as one "core hour" (sometimes also named as a "CPU hour") per core you have been allocated, for each wallclock hour that it runs. On the other hand, a "**node**" job is accounted on your project as sixteen core hours for each wallclock hour that it runs, multiplied with the number of nodes that you have asked for.

### Node types

Rackham has two node types, _thin_ being the typical cluster node and _fat_ nodes having double the amount of memory available normally (256 GB). You may specify a node with more RAM, by adding the words "**\-C mem256GB**" or "**\-C fat**" to your job submission line and thus making sure that you will get 256 GB of RAM on each node in your job. If you need even more memory you can request a 512 GB memory node by adding "**\-C mem512GB**". Please note that there are only 13 nodes with 256GB and 17 with 512GB of RAM.

**To request a fat node, use -C mem256GB or -C fat in your Slurm command.** 

**To request the fattest nodes, use -C mem512GB in your Slurm command.** 

## File storage and disk space

At UPPMAX we have a few different kinds of storage areas for files, see [Disk Storage User Guide](http://uppmax.uu.se/support/user-guides/disk-storage-guide/ "File Storage") for more information and recommended use.

## Very Long jobs

If you have very long jobs that require more than 10 days of CPU-time. We recommend using Snowy.  
But in order for our job to successfully run for severay weeks you should implement the following;

*   Use only local disk for your job. Copy all input and data files needed to **$SNIC\_TMP** at the start of your job and at the end, copy all output back to your project directory.
*   Book a full node with the Slurm flags **\-p node** (you won't be able to submit these jobs in the core partition).
*   If possible make sure you do not rely on files stored outside the node. One way of achieving this may be to copy program files to $SNIC\_TMP.

Even if you do this we can't promise that a 20 or 30 day long job will finish without being interrupted by the global file systems, the network or problems on the node,
