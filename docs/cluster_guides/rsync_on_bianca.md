# `rsync` on Bianca

[`rsync`](../software/rsync.md) is a command-line tool 
for [file transfer](../cluster_guides/file_transfer.md).

This page describes how to use [`rsync`](../software/rsync.md) on [Bianca](bianca.md).

One cannot `rsync` directly to `wharf`.

???- question "How does it look like if I try to `rsync` directly to `wharf` anyways?"

    One cannot `rsync` directly to `wharf`.

    However, this is how it looks like:
    

	```
	richel@richel-N141CU:~$ rsync my_local_file.txt richel-sens2016001@bianca-sftp.uppmax.uu.se:/richel-sens2016001

	Hi!

	You are connected to the bianca wharf (sftp service) at 
	bianca-sftp.uppmax.uu.se.

	Note that we only support SFTP, which is not exactly the
	same as SSH (rsync and scp will not work). 

	Please see our homepage and the Bianca User Guide
	for more information:

	https://www.uppmax.uu.se/support/user-guides/bianca-user-guide/

	If you have any questions not covered by the User Guide, you are
	welcome to contact us at support@uppmax.uu.se.

	Best regards,
	UPPMAX
