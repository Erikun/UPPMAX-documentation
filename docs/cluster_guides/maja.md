# Maja

Maja is an upcoming UPPMAX cluster for sensitive data,
taking over from [Bianca](bianca.md).

## Features of Maja, compared to Bianca

Although we from UPPMAX cannot say exactly how Maja will look,
we try to keep her similar to Bianca.

## Migration from Bianca to Maja

As both clusters are UPPMAX clusters,
we are probably able to tranfer your data from Bianca
to Maja.
