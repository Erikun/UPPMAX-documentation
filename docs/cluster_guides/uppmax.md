# UPPMAX

[UPPMAX in an organization](uppmax_as_an_organization.md)
that provides HPC infrastructure that is physically located in Uppsala.
To do so, it provides the [UPPMAX systems](uppmax_systems.md) below.

## UPPMAX systems

Here we place Bianca between the other UPPMAX systems.

There are three types of UPPMAX systems:

- Computing systems
- Storage systems
- Cloud services

[Apply for these resources](../getting_started/project_apply.md).

### UPPMAX computing systems

Computing systems allow a user to do heavier computational calculations.
At UPPMAX, we use [multiple HPC clusters](uppmax_cluster.md)

### UPPMAX storage systems

See [UPPMAX systems](uppmax_systems.md).

### UPPMAX Cloud services

See [UPPMAX systems](uppmax_systems.md).

Cloud services allow a user to have something active (typically a website)
that can be accessed by the internet.
