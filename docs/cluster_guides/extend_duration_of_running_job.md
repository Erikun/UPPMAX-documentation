# How to extend the duration of a job that is running?

There are many [UPPMAX cluster frequenly asked questions](cluster_guide_faq.md).
This page describes how to extend a job that has been running for a long
time and is near its duration limit.

## Casus

You need to do a hard calculation.
It is expected to take a log time, hence
you set the time limit to the maximum time limit of 10 days.

At the 8th day, you see that the job is completed for only 75%,
hence you need a bit more extra days.
