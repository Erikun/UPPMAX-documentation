# Dardel migration

![Dardel server racks](./img/dardel_racks.png)

This page describes how to transfer files to Dardel,
the HPC cluster at PDC in Stockholm.

???- question "Why do I need this?"

    The Rackham cluster will be decommissioned at the end of 2024 
    so all projects have to migrate their data and calculations to other resources. 
    The plan from NAISS is that all Rackham users 
    will move to the Dardel cluster at PDC.

    To facilitate this move, 
    we have created a tool that makes the transfer easier.

## Procedure

First, we are here to help.
Please [contact support](../support.md) if you run into problems
when trying the guide below.

This migration consists of a couple of steps summarized below. 
Press the links to get more detailed explanation of each step.
Note that step 1 requires some hours of waiting
and step 2 requires an overnight wait.

### 1. Get access to a SUPR project with Dardel

First step is to get get access to a SUPR project with Dardel.
This is described at [PDC's page on getting access to Dardel](https://www.pdc.kth.se/support/documents/getting_access/get_access.html).
You will get an email when you are added to a project,
this can take some hours.

???- question "How do I know I have access to a Dardel project?"

    Login to [https://supr.naiss.se/](https://supr.naiss.se/).
    If there is a PDC project,
    you may have access to a project with Dardel.

    ![](./img/supr_naiss_dardel_project.png)

    > Example user that has access to a PDC project

    If you may a PDC project that does not use Dardel,
    click on the project to go the the project overview.

    ![](./img/supr_naiss_dardel_project_overview.png)

    > Example PDC project overview

    From there, scroll down to 'Resources'.
    If you see 'Dardel' among the compute resources, 
    you have confirmed you have access to a Dardel project.

    ![](./img/naiss_project_dardel_resources.png)

    > Resources from an example PDC project

### 2. Get a PDC account via SUPR

Get a PDC account via SUPR.
This is described at [the PDC page on getting access](https://www.pdc.kth.se/support/documents/getting_access/get_access.html#supr-account).
You will get a PDC account overnight.

???- question "How do I know I have a PDC account?"

    Login to [https://supr.naiss.se/](https://supr.naiss.se/).
    and click on 'Accounts' in the main menu bar at the left.

    If you see 'Dardel' among the resources, and status 'Enabled'
    in the same row, you have a PDC account!

    ![](./img/supr_naiss_dardel_account.png)

### 3. Create SSH key pair

See [create and use an SSH key pair for Dardel, step 1](../software/ssh_key_use_dardel.md/#1-how-to-create-ssh-keys).


Spoiler: on Rackham, do:

```bash
module load darsync
darsync sshkey
```

### 4. Add the public key to the PDC Login Portal

See [create and use an SSH key pair for Dardel, step 2](../software/ssh_key_use_dardel.md/#2-how-to-add-an-ssh-key-to-the-pdc-login-portal), 
to see how to upload the public SSH key to the PDC Login Portal.

### 5. Run Darsync

Run the migration tool [Darsync](../cluster_guides/darsync.md). 

#### 5.1 Load the module for Darsync

First step, is to load the `darsync` [module](modules.md):

```bash
module load darsync
```

#### 5.2 Check for problems

This second step is optional, yet may help against possible problems.

Running `darsync check` will make Darsync prompt for questions:


```bash
darsync check
```

???- question "How do I give the arguments from the command line?"

    If you prefer to specify everything from the command-line, do:

    ```bash
    darsync check --local-dir [foldername]
    ```

    where `[foldername]` is the name to a folder, 
    for example `darsync check --local-dir ~/my_folder`.

    There are some more optional arguments, see these by doing:

    ```bash
    darsync check --help
    ```

If there are problems reported, [contact support](../support.md)
or try to fix them yourself.

???- question "What is the file `darsync_[dirname].ownership.gz`?"

    This is a file containing file ownership information.
    This file can be used to make sure that the
    file ownership (user/group) will look the same on Dardel 
    as it does on Rackham.

???- question "Can I delete the file `darsync_[dirname].ownership.gz`?"

    Yes, as it is not needed in the next step.

    However, it is a small file that allows UPPMAX support
    to help in case of migration problems.

    On the other hand, you can regenerate the file 
    as long as the files you are migrating are still present.
    
#### 5.3 Generate script

In this third step, the [Slurm](slurm.md) script is created.

!!! info "A lot of questions"

    The script will ask multiple questions. 
    Below it is described how to get the answers :-)

Running `darsync gen` will make Darsync prompt for questions:


```bash
darsync gen
```

???- question "How do I give the arguments from the command line?"

    If you prefer to specify everything from the command-line, do:

    ```bash
    darsync gen \
      --local-dir [foldername] \
      --slurm-account [slurm_account] \
      --username [pdc_username] \
      --ssh-key [private_ssh_key_path] \
      --outfile [output_filename]
    ```

    where 

    - `[foldername]` is the name to a folder, e.g. `~/my_folder`
    - `[slurm_account]` is the UPPMAX project ID, e.g. `uppmax2023-2-25`
    - `[pdc_username]` is your PDC username, e.g `svenan`
    - `[private_ssh_key_path]` is the path the private SSH key, e.g. `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_pdc`
    - `[output_filename]` is the name of the Slurm output file, e.g. `~/dardel_transfer_script.sh`

    resulting in:

    ```bash
    darsync gen \
      --local-dir ~/my_folder \
      --slurm-account uppmax2023-2-25 \
      --username svenan \
      --ssh-key ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_pdc \
      --outfile ~/dardel_transfer_script.sh
    ```

    There are some more optional arguments, see these by doing:

    ```bash
    darsync gen --help
    ```

In case of a typo, you can also modify `dardel_transfer_script.sh`,
which is a regular [Slurm](slurm.md) script.

???- question "How to find out my UPPMAX project ID?"

    The UPPMAX project ID is used in your [Slurm](slurm.md) scripts,
    with the `-A` flag.

    Your UPPMAX project IDs can be found at [https://supr.naiss.se/](https://supr.naiss.se/).
    UPPMAX projects for Rackham usually start with `NAISS` or `UPPMAX`
    and have '(UPPMAX)' after the project name.

    Here is how to convert the UPPMAX project name to UPPMAX project ID:

    UPPMAX project name|UPPMAX project ID
    -------------------|-----------------
    NAISS 2024/22-49   |`naiss2024-22-49`
    UPPMAX 2023/2-25   |`uppmax2023-2-25`

    ![](supr_naiss_example_projects.png)

    > Example [https://supr.naiss.se/](https://supr.naiss.se/) page.
    > Eligible candidates seem 'NAISS 2024/22-49' and 'UPPMAX 2023/2-25'.

???- question "How to find out my PDC username?"

    Login to [https://supr.naiss.se/](https://supr.naiss.se/).
    and click on 'Accounts' in the main menu bar at the left.

    If you see 'Dardel' among the resources, and status 'Enabled'
    in the same row, you have a PDC account.
    In the first column of such a row, you will see your username

    ![](./img/supr_naiss_dardel_account.png)

    > Example of a user having an account at PDC's Dardel HPC cluster.
    > In this case, the username is `richelbi`

???- question "How to find out where on Dardel I will transfer your data to?"

    * Your home folder: `/cfs/klemming/home/r/[username]`,
      where `[username]` is your PDC username,
      for example `/cfs/klemming/home/r/sven`
    * Your project folder: `/cfs/klemming/projects/[project_storage]`,
      where `[project_storage]` is your PDC project storage folder,
      for example `/cfs/klemming/projects/snic/naiss2023-22-1027`

    ![](./img/supr_naiss_dardel_storage.png)

    > Composite image of a PDC project and its associated storage folder 
    > at the bottom. 
    > In this case, the full folder name is `/cfs/klemming/projects/snic/naiss2023-22-10271`

### 6. Submit the script created by Darsync

Submit the transfer script created by Darsync to SLURM.

```bash
sbatch --output=~/dardel_transfer.out --error=~/dardel_transfer.err ~/dardel_transfer_script.sh
```

???- question "I get an error 'sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed'. What do I do?"

    It means that the script created for you, `dardel_transfer_script.sh`,
    has a mistake.

    See [Slurm troubleshooting](slurm_troubleshooting.md) for guidance
    on how to troubleshoot this.

### 7. Check logs

Once the submitted job has finished, have a look at the log file produced by the job and make sure it did not end in a error message.

```bash
tail ~/dardel_transfer.out
tail ~/dardel_transfer.err
```

### 8. Delete the SSH key

After the migration, these temporary SSH keys can and should be deleted:

```bash
rm ~/id_ed25519_pdc*
```

## Troubleshooting

???- question "What is the file `darsync_[dirname].ownership.gz`?"

    This is a file containing file ownership information. When a user transfer all the files
    in a project to a project at Dardel, all the files at Dardel will be owned by the user
    who did the transfer. By saving the ownership information of the files at UPPMAX,
    we can map the file ownership information to the corresponding users at Dardel.

???- question "Can I delete the file `darsync_[dirname].ownership.gz`?"

    No, keep it until you delete your project at UPPMAX, or better yet,
    copy that file to Dardel as well. If you discover that you get
    problems because of wrong owner of files (write permissions etc),
    this file contains the information needed to recreate it as it 
    was before your transfered the files, even if your UPPMAX
    project has already been deleted.

???- question "I get the error: `ssh: connect to host dardel.pdc.kth.se port 22: No route to host`. How do I fix this?"

    ```
    [richel@rackham1 ~]$ bash /domus/h1/richel/dardel_transfer_script.sh
    ssh: connect to host dardel.pdc.kth.se port 22: No route to host
    rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [sender]
    rsync error: unexplained error (code 255) at io.c(226) [sender=3.1.2]
    ```

    This means that Dardel is down, probably due to maintenance.

    You can do nothing, except wait until Dardel is up again.
