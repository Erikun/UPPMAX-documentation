## Security

Since Bianca is designed to handle sensitive personal data security is a key aspect of the configuration. In order to ensure that the data is safe we have implemented a series of security measures including, but not limited to:

- One virtualized cluster per project, no resources are shared between projects.
- Separate storage volumes per project.
- Detailed logging of file transfers in and out of the cluster.
- Two factor authentication
- No internet access inside the clusters.
- Locked racks for the hardware
- Destruction of broken hard drives

Uppsala University has decided on the following KRT classifications for Bianca:

- 321 for project directories
- 322 for home directories
