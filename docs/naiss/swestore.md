Swestore is a NAISS HPC center hosting the storage system called 'dCache'.

This is the information from SUPR:

```text
dCache is a resource at Swestore. The total capacity allocated in this round is 100 TiB. The round upper limit is 10 TiB.

Swestore is a Research Data Storage Infrastructure, intended for active research data and operated by the National Academic Infrastructure for Supercomputing in Sweden, NAISS,

The storage resources provided by Swestore are made available for free for academic research funded by VR and Formas through open calls such that the best Swedish research is supported and new research is facilitated.

The purpose of Swestore allocations, granted by National Allocations Committee (NAC), is to provide large scale data storage for “live” or “working” research data, also known as active research data.

!!! warning "Times are changing"

The following information appears at
application rounds and in decision mails from first of January 2025:

```text
Please note: NAISS can currently only approve storage on dCache at Swestore until 2026-01-01. Storage solutions for non-hot data, such as Swestore, is being investigated in accelerated form by NAISS very early 2025, and we hope to communicate the plan for long-term services before the large allocation rounds in spring 2025 are opened.
