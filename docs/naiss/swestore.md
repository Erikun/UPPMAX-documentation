# SweStore

SweStore is a NAISS HPC center hosting the storage system called 'dCache'.

The following information will appear for dCache at Swestore in the 2025
application rounds and in decision mails from first of January 2025:

"NAISS can currently only approve storage on dCache at Swestore until
2026-01-01. Storage solutions for non-hot data, such as Swestore,
is being investigated in accelerated form by NAISS very early 2025,
and we hope to communicate the plan for long-term services
before the large allocation rounds in spring 2025 are opened".
