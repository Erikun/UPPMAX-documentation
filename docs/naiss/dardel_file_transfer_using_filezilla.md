FileZilla is a secure file transfer tool that works under Linux, Mac and Windows.

To transfer files to/from Dardel using FileZilla, do
the following steps:

### 1. Install `putty-tools`

```bash
sudo apt install putty-tools
```

### 2. Create the needed files in the `.ssh` folder

Navigate into the `.ssh` folder.

```bash
cd .ssh
```

#### 2.1 Create the `.ppk` file

In the `.ssh` folder, from a terminal do:

```bash
puttygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "[dardel_username]@dardel.pdc.kth.se" -o [filename].ppk
```

For example:

```bash
puttygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "svensv@dardel.pdc.kth.se" -o dardel_filezilla.ppk
```

#### 2.2 Extract the private SSH key from the `.ppk` file

In the `.ssh` folder, from a terminal do:

```bash
puttygen -O private-openssh-new [filename].ppk -o [filename]
```

For example:

```bash
puttygen -O private-openssh-new dardel_filezilla.ppk -o dardel_filezilla
```

#### 2.2 Extract the public SSH key from the `.ppk` file

In the `.ssh` folder, from a terminal do:

```bash
puttygen -O public-openssh [filename].ppk -o [filename].pub
```

For example:

```bash
puttygen -O public-openssh dardel_filezilla.ppk -o dardel_filezilla.pub
```
