# Awk workshop

AWK is an interpreted programming language designed for text processing and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool.

This two-days workshop aims to promote and demonstrate the flexibility of the tool, where the overhead of more sophisticated approaches and programming languages is not worth the bother.

## Learn how to

- use Awk as **an advanced** grep command, capable of arithmetic selection rules with control over the content of the matched lines
- perform simple conversions, analysis or filter you data on the fly making it easy to plot or read in your favorite research tool
- handle and take advantage on data split over multiple file data sets.
- use Awk as simple function or data generator
- perform simple sanity checks on your results

## Awk for bioinformaticians

Use what you learn and dive into the basic concepts of bioinformatics with simple exercises on typical scientific problems and tasks.

- Multiple input files - second approach scenario will be discussed.
- How to trick `awk` to accept options on the command line
  like regular program,
  i.e. `$ script.awk filename parameter1 parameter2`
  [from Pavlin's notes](https://pmitev.github.io/to-awk-or-not/More_awk/Command_params/)
- [Declaring and calling functions in awk](https://pmitev.github.io/to-awk-or-not/More_awk/User_defined_functions/)
- Input/output to/from an external programs
- Learn how to send input to an external program (might be based on your data)
  and read the result back,
  [from Pavlin's notes](https://pmitev.github.io/to-awk-or-not/More_awk/Input_output/)
- Handy tips: awk oneliners use with Vim, gnuplot…

## Prerequisites

---

### MacOS

The system provided awk version will work for most of the examples during the workshop with few exceptions, which are noted in the online material.

_Tilda `~` sign on Mac with Swedish keyboard layout - Alt + ^_

### Linux

Several distributions have other awk flavors installed by default. The easiest fix is to install the gnu version gawk i.e. for Ubuntu: `sudo apt install gawk`

### Windows 10/11

- [Ubuntu for Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) - it is better to read from the source, despite it might not be the easiest tutorial. To my experience, this is the best Linux environment without virtualization.
- [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) use the internal package manager to install gawk. The default is provided by Busybox and is not enough for the purpose of the workshop.

### Linux computer center

- Just login to your account and use the provided awk - any version newer than 4 will work.

```bash
rackham3:[~] awk -V GNU Awk 4.0.2 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991-2012 Free Software Foundation.
```

### Virtual Linux Machine

Just follow some tutorial on how to setup and use the virtual Linux environment.

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [Ubuntu on Public Clouds](https://ubuntu.com/public-cloud)
- [GitHub & Binder](https://pmitev.github.io/to-awk-or-not/Other/Binder/) (you need only a browser)
- [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/) `singularity run shub://pmitev/Teoroo-singularity:gawk 'BEGIN{ for(i=1;i<=4;i++) print i}'`
