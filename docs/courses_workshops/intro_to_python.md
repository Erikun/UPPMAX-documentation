    This 1-day course helps you get started with Python,
    by working through an online and free book.
    We make use of HPC clusters
    to write and run Python code.
    The pace of this highly interactive course
    is set by the majority of learners,
    ensuring that any complete beginner
    has enough time for exercises.
    At the end of the day, you should feel comfortable with the basics
    of Python and feel familiar to a book on Python to help you on your next steps.
