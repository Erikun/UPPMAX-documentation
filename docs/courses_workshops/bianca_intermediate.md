# Bianca In-Depth Workshop/Hackathon: Improve Your Handling of Sensitive Research Data

## Overview and schedule

Are you already working with sensitive data in your research and feel your workflow can be improved? If yes, welcome to a full day of learning of smarter ways to work on the Bianca UPPMAX cluster. We will tell you how to login from a terminal (bypassing ThinLinc), do file transfer from a terminal (allowing scripts), advanced Slurm, using IDEs (i.e. RStudio and/or VSCode), and installing custom software and packages.

This is a Q&A-based hackathon for **intermediate** users of Bianca.

**Prerequisites:** being able to login to Bianca, submit a Slurm bash script, and know how to transfer files.

You do not need to be a member of a NAISS-SENS project in order to join the workshop. A SUPR course project will be available to all participants. The workshop will consist of both lectures and exercise sessions.

**When:** Friday, May 23, 2025.
**Time:** 09:00 - 12:00, and 13:00 - 16:00.
**Where:** online via Zoom. Connection details will be sent to registered participants.

**Registration form**, not yet open

The workshop will consist of short lectures and longer Q&A sessions.
