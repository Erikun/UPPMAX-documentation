# Programming formalisms

This course aims to give life scientists, bioinformaticians, and other scientists with some experience in programming and scripting an understanding of the underlying principles of software development, design, and programming. The course aims to strengthen the understanding of more advanced programming concepts, ability to produce more reusable scripts through modular programming and to enable a better understanding of how to evaluate a script or programs performance.

We will cover:

- an introduction to Algorithms and Data structures
- programming Paradigms especially structured and object oriented programming
- an overview of other paradigms like functional programming.
- modular development and (code) reusability, testing and optimisation.

We will cover theory with bridging practical examples and applications to enhance the theoretical understanding of the principles.

**Prerequisites:** We recommend basic knowledge in the following topics.

- Git, of either
    - [NBIS/ELIXIR-SE Tools for Reproducible research](https://nbis-reproducible-research.readthedocs.io/en/course_2104/)
    - or the CodeRefinery courses [Introduction to version control with Git](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/) and [Collaborative distributed version control](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/).
- We assume familiarity with python at least equivalent of the [Intro to Python course](https://uppmax.github.io/uppmax_intro_python/) or [Python programming with applications to bioinformatics](https://uppsala.instructure.com/courses/85913).
