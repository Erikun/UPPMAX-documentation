- feedback, e.g [Log in: one page too many](https://github.com/UPPMAX/UPPMAX-documentation/issues/174)
- messages, e.g [Chromium renders mermaid graphs incorrectly](https://github.com/UPPMAX/UPPMAX-documentation/issues/176)

Anyone with a GitHub account can create an [issue](https://github.com/UPPMAX/UPPMAX-documentation/issues).

    - Log in to your GitHub account
    - Go to [the issues](https://github.com/UPPMAX/UPPMAX-documentation/issues)
    - Click on the green button 'Create issue'
    
    ![Click on 'Create issue'](img/create_issue_with_border.png)

    > Click on 'Create issue'

    - Write a title and description
    - At the bottom of the page, click the green button 'Create'

These issues will be discussed in a meeting and/or in the issue itself.

Ideas that improve the experience of UPPMAX users trying to use our resources
are likely to be accepted.

## Modify content

The goal of the UPPMAX documentation is to document how to use our resources.
We welcome any contribution that helps us achieve this goal.

  (e.g. use 4 spaces for indentation).

Anyone with a GitHub account can suggest changes by clicking the 'Edit'
button, which is present on each document page.

## Contribution questions

## How long does it take until I see my changes on the website?

When your changes are committed to our main branch,
it takes several minutes until these are live.

One can see the process at
[the Actions page of this repository](https://github.com/UPPMAX/UPPMAX-documentation/actions).

## What if I make a mistake?

This repository has version control. Hence, if needed, we can undo any mistake.

It is more typical that mistakes are fixed.

## Where to put a new page: here or at <https://www.uu.se/en/centre/uppmax>?

[It has been decided upon](https://github.com/UPPMAX/UPPMAX-documentation/issues/128)
that, as a general rule,
information should be on SiteVision until a user applies to a project.
This means that information about applying for a project
and using our clusters should be on this repository.

[It has been decided upon too](https://github.com/UPPMAX/UPPMAX-documentation/issues/128)
to try hard for minimal duplication.

[Specific points that have been decided upon](https://github.com/UPPMAX/UPPMAX-documentation/issues/128):

## Where to put files in this repository?

All files are put in `docs` or `docs/[some_folder]`,
but not not deeper than that.
