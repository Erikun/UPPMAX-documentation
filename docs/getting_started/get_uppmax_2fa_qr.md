# Setting up the QR code for two factor authentication for UPPMAX 

Part of [setting up two factor authentication for UPPMAX](get_uppmax_2fa.md)
is to get a QR code.

You need to scan this QR code to add your account to your software. Most softwares call this "Add account" or similar and will offer an option to scan a QR code using the smartphone camera or select an area of the screen where the code is.

Note that this must often be done from within the app for two factor authentication. If you see a string similar to

otpauth://totp/username@UPPMAX?secret=SOMETEXT&issuer=UPPMAX

it didn't work and you probably need to do something different (such as starting the app and select scan from within).

Once you've scanned the code, you are often allowed to change the name the software will use for the account before you add it. You can change the name if you want - changing the name does not affect the codes generated. Finish adding the account to the software.
