# Login to the Bianca remote desktop environment via a ThinLinc client

There are multiple ways to [log in to Bianca](login_bianca.md).
Accessing Bianca's remote desktop environment via a
local [ThinLinc](../software/thinlinc.md) client, however,
is impossible: one can only [access Bianca remote desktop environment via a website](login_bianca_remote_desktop_website.md).

This page is here for UPPMAX staff only (no page links to this one),
so they remember this is impossible.
See [this Issue](https://github.com/UPPMAX/UPPMAX-documentation/issues/38)
for a dialog.
