# Login to the Bianca remote desktop environment via a ThinLinc client

There are multiple ways to [log in to Bianca](login_bianca.md).

Accessing Bianca's remote desktop environment via a
local [ThinLinc](../software/thinlinc.md) client
is impossible.

One can only [access Bianca remote desktop environment via a website](login_bianca_remote_desktop_website.md).
