# Log in

One needs to log in into an UPPMAX cluster to use it.

There are two environments one can login to:

- a remote desktop environment
  - using a webbrowser
  - using a local ThinLinc client
- a console environment, using an SSH client

> At the the right is the console environment.

Because logging in differs between clusters, each cluster
has its own login page:

- [Login to Bianca](login_bianca.md)
- [Login to Rackham](login_rackham.md)
- [Login to Snowy](login_snowy.md)

Go to those pages for more details.
