# Log in

One needs to log in into an UPPMAX cluster to use it.

There are two environments one can login to:

- a remote desktop environment
  - using a webbrowser
  - using a local ThinLinc client
- a console environment, using an SSH client

> At the the right is the console environment.

Because logging in differs between clusters, each cluster
has its own login page:

- [Login to Bianca](login_bianca.md)
- [Login to Rackham](login_rackham.md)
- [Login to Snowy](login_snowy.md)

Go to those pages for more details.

Other things to log in to:

- [Login to Dardel](login_dardel.md) (this is not an UPPMAX cluster)
- [Login to Transit](../cluster_guides/login_transit.md) (this is an UPPMAX service, not a cluster)
