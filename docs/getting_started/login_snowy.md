# Log in to Snowy

Here we describe how to log in to [Snowy](../cluster_guides/snowy.md)

## Prerequisites

To be allowed to use Snowy, one needs all of these:

- [ ] An active research project
- [ ] An UPPMAX account
- [ ] An UPPMAX password

- User account: visit the [UPPMAX page on user accounts](user_account.md)
- A local UPPMAX project: see [project](project.md).
  Snowy is available as compute nodes only

## Reach the Snowy compute nodes

To make Snowy do a calculation, one needs to log in to a Rackham login node,
which is described [here](../getting_started/login_rackham.md).

After logging in, one can

- [Start a batch job using Snowy resources](../cluster_guides/slurm.md)
- [Start an interactive job](../cluster_guides/start_interactive_node_on_snowy.md)


```mermaid
    graph TB

    Node1 -- interactive --> SubGraph2Flow
    Node1 -- sbatch --> SubGraph2Flow
    subgraph "Snowy"
    SubGraph2Flow(calculation nodes)
    end


    subgraph "Rackham"
    Node1[Login] -- interactive --> Node2[calculation nodes]
    Node1 -- sbatch --> Node2
    end
```
