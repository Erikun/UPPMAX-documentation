# Project application

To use [UPPMAX](../cluster_guides/uppmax.md) resources, one needs:

- [an active research project](project.md)
- [an UPPMAX user account](user_account.md)

Your user account is a personal log-in to our systems. Computer resources like CPU-hours and disk storage are allocated to projects.

The workflow is like this:

- Register in SUPR
- Accept SUPR user agreement
- Become a member of a project
- Apply for a user account at UPPMAX (or other resources)

!!! warning

    Note that you can only get a user account on a resource if you belong to a project with allocations there!

!!! tip

    [UPPMAX rules](https://www.uu.se/en/centre/uppmax/get-started/apply-for-project-and-create-user-account/information-about-projects/uppmax-rules)

## SUPR account

- [Register at SUPR](supr_register.md)
- [Accept the user agreement in SUPR](supr_register.md#accept-the-user-agreement)

## Applying for an UPPMAX project (PI)

If you are a PI: apply for a project in SUPR.

- [Apply for a Bianca project](project_apply_bianca.md), i.e. a project
  using sensitive data
- [Apply for a Pelle project](project_apply_pelle.md), i.e. a project
  for the new Uppsala-local general-purpose cluster

## Become a member of a project

If you are not a PI: Apply for membership in a project you want to join in SUPR, Wait for the PI to accept your application. Alternatively, the PI can add you directly.

- [Join an existing project](join_existing_project.md).

???- question "I just got an UPPMAX project, yet I cannot login to UPPMAX?"

    It tends to be a matter of minutes to less than hours
    before the changes propagate from SUPR to UPPMAX.

    If after one night you cannot login,
    please [contact support](../support.md).

## Apply for an account at UPPMAX

If you don't already have an account at UPPMAX you are ready by now!
