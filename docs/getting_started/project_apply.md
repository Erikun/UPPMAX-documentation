# Project application

??? t2s "Text to speech"
    <audio src="../project_apply.mp3" controls preload></audio>

To use [UPPMAX](../cluster_guides/uppmax.md) resources, one needs:

- [an active research project](project.md)
- [an UPPMAX user account](user_account.md)

This page is about applying for an UPPMAX project.

???- question "I just got an UPPMAX project, yet I cannot login to UPPMAX?"

    It tends to be a matter of minutes to less than hours
    before the changes propagate from SUPR to UPPMAX.

    If after one night you cannot login, 
    please [contact support](../support.md).

## The projects

- No cost to researchers all over Sweden. 
- 3 different levels regarding storage and core hours per month

<https://uppmax.uu.se/support/getting-started/applying-for-projects/>

### Compute at UPPMAX (always with 128 GB storage)

- Small: 2000 cpu-hrs/month
    - Can be increased to 10,000 hrs
    - PI: PhD student or higher.
- Medium: 10,000-200,000 cpu-hs/month
    - PI: Assistant professor (forskarassistent) or higher. 
- Large 100,000 cpu-hs/month
    - PI: Assistant professor (forskarassistent) or higher. 

### Storage at UPPMAX

- Small: 128 GB-10 TB of storage. 
    - Can be increased to 10,000 hrs
    - PI: PhD student or higher.
- Medium: 10-100 TB 
    - PI: Assistant professor (forskarassistent) or higher. 
- Large: More than 100 TB 
    - PI: Assistant professor (forskarassistent) or higher.

## SNIC Science Cloud (SSC)

- Complement, offering "advanced functionality" to users who:

    - need more flexible access to resources
        - e.g. more control over the OS:s and software environments
    - want to develop software as a service
    - want to explore recent technology such as for
        - IoT applications 
        - “Big Data” e.g. Apache Hadoop/Spark


- The UPPMAX cloud Dis (Swedish word for "haze")  was introduced in October 2017 and upgraded during 2020.
    - East region in the SNIC Science Cloud <https://www.uppmax.uu.se/resources/systems/the-uppmax-cloud/>

- Other clouds

    - Umeå University (North, HPC2N).

    - Chalmers University (West, C3SE).

## Storage

### SNIC Storage: Swestore

- The purpose of Swestore allocations, granted by Swedish National Allocations Committee (SNAC), is to provide large scale data storage for “live” or “working” research data, also known as active research data.
