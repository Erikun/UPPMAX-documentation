# Login to the Bianca console environment with a password

There are multiple ways to [log in to Bianca](login_bianca.md).

This page describes how to [log in to Bianca](login_bianca.md)
using a terminal and a password.

When inside SUNET, one can access a Bianca console environment
using SSH with an SSH password.

???- question "Forgot how to get within SUNET?"

    See the 'get inside the university networks' page [here](../getting_started/get_inside_sunet.md)

## 1. Use `ssh` to log in

From a terminal, use [`ssh`](../software/ssh.md) to log in:

```bash
ssh [user]-[project name]@bianca.uppmax.uu.se
```

For example:

```bash
ssh sven-sens2023598@bianca.uppmax.uu.se
```

???- question "How does it look like when outside of SUNET?"

    [Here](https://youtu.be/W-PMTyNcbYI?si=iYxNToDb-EpTdnAO&t=79) you can
    see how this looks like when outside of SUNET.

    Spoiler: quite dull, as nothing happens until these is a timeout.

???- question "Why no `-A`?"

    On Bianca, one can use `-A`:

    ```bash
    ssh -A username@bianca.uppmax.uu.se
    ```

    this option is only useful when you want to
    [log in to Bianca via the console using an SSH key](login_bianca_console_ssh_key.md).
    As we here use passwords (i.e. no SSH keys)
    to access Bianca, `-A` is unused
    and hence we simplify this documentation by omitting it.

???- question "Why no `-X`?"

    On Rackham, one can use `-X`:

    ```bash
    ssh -X username@rackham.uppmax.uu.se
    ```

    However, on Bianca, this so-called
    [X forwarding](../software/ssh_x_forwarding.md) is disabled.
    Hence, we do not teach it :-)


## 2. Type your UPPMAX password with 2FA

Type your UPPMAX password,
directly followed by the UPPMAX 2-factor authentication number,
for example `verysecret678123`, then press enter.
In this case, the password is `verysecret` and `678123`
is the 2FA number.

After authenticated using the UPPMAX password and 2FA,
you are logged in on Bianca's shared network,
on a so-called 'jumphost'.

However, you will still need to login to your own
private virtual project cluster.
As you are already properly authenticated (i.e. using an UPPMAX password
and UPPMAX 2FA), you don't need 2FA anymore.

???- question "What is a virtual project cluster?"

    As Bianca holds sensitive data, by regulations,
    each Bianca project must be isolated from each other
    and are not allowed to, for example, share the same memory.

    One way to achieve this, would be to build one HPC cluster
    per project. While this would guarantee isolated project environments,
    this would be quite impractical.

    Instead, we create isolated project environments by using software,
    that creates so-called virtual clusters, as if they would be
    physical clusters. Like physical clusters, a virtual cluster
    has a guaranteed isolated project environment.

When you login to Bianca's shared network,
you will get a message of your project's login node status.
It can be `up and running` or `down`.
If it is `down`, the virtual cluster is started,
which may take some minutes.

## 3. Type your UPPMAX password

Type your UPPMAX password,
for example `verysecret`

## 4. You are in

Enjoy! You are in! Or, to be precise,
you are on the [login node](../cluster_guides/login_node.md) of your own virtual project cluster.

!!! note "How to behave on a login node"

    On a login node, one can and should do simple things only:
    it is a resource shared with all other users on that node.

    If you need to do more intense calculations,
    [use the Slurm job scheduler](../cluster_guides/slurm_on_rackham.md).

    If you need to do more intense calculations interactively,
    [use an interactive node](../cluster_guides/start_interactive_node_on_rackham.md).

By default, this node has one core,
hence if you need more memory or more CPU power,
you submit a job (interactive or batch),
and an idle node will be moved into your project cluster.
