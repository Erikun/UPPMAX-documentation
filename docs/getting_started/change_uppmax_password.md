If you know your UPPMAX password,
here is how to change it.

???- question "Forgot your UPPMAX password?"

    Go to [How to reset your UPPMAX password](reset_uppmax_password.md).


## Procedure

### 1. Log in to your favorite UPPMAX cluster

See [How to login to an UPPMAX cluster](login.md).

### 2. Open a terminal

When logged in to an UPPMAX cluster, open a terminal.
If you've logged in via SSH, you are already in a terminal :-)

### 3. Set your own password

In that terminal, type:

```bash
passwd
```

Now you will be asked to repeat the old password and set a new one!

Your new password will work immediately!
