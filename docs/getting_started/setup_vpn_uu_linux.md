# Setup a VPN from Uppsala University for Linux

How to [set up a VPN](setup_vpn.md) differs between universities
and differs between operating systems.
This page describes how to set up a VPN from Uppsala University for Linux.

## Procedure

### 1. Install the needed packages

In a terminal, do:

```bash
sudo apt-get install openconnect network-manager-openconnect network-manager-openconnect-gnome
```

??? question "How does that look like?"

	You output look similar to this:

	```bash
	sven@svens_computer:~$ sudo apt-get install openconnect network-manager-openconnect network-manager-openconnect-gnome
	[sudo] password for sven:

## 2. Add the VPN

Go to the 'Settings'

??? question "How do I get there?"

    Press the meta/windows/command key
    (the one between `CTRL` and `ALT` that is not called `FN`).

    When typing `settings`, it will pop up. Click it.
    Or move there with the arrow keys and press enter. 

    ![Ubuntu after pressing the meta key and typing setting](./img/ubuntu_meta_type_settings.png)

Go to 'Network'.

??? question "How does that look like?"

    ![In the Ubuntu settings, click Network](./img/ubuntu_settings_click_network.png)

In the VPN section, click on the plus to add a VPN.

??? question "How does that look like?"

    ![In the VPN section, click on the plus to add a VPN](./img/ubuntu_network_settings_click_add_vpn.png)

In the 'Add VPN' dialog, click on 'Multi-protocol VPN client (openconnect)'.

??? question "How does that look like?"

    ![In the 'Add VPN' dialog, click on 'Multi-protocol VPN client'](./img/ubuntu_network_settings_add_vpn_click_multi_protocol.png)

In the 'Add VPN' dialog, click on the 'Identity' tab.

??? question "How does that look like?"

    ![In the 'Add VPN' dialog, click on the 'Identity' tab](./img/ubuntu_network_settings_add_vpn_dialog_click_identity.png)

In the 'Indentity' tab, set up the following values:

Field     |Value
----------|--------------------------------------------
Name      |Any name, e.g. `My Uppasala University VPN`
Gateay    |`vpn.uu.se`
User Agent|`AnyConnect Linux_64 4.7.00136`

??? question "How does that look like?"

    ![The 'Indentity' tab, with the values filled in](./img/ubuntu_network_settings_add_vpn_identity_settings.png)
 
Now you have added the VPN.

## 3. Activate the VPN

In the Ubuntu network settings, we can see our inactive VPN.

Click on the slider right of our UU VPN.

??? question "How does that look like?"

    ![Click on the slider right of our UU VPN](./img/ubuntu_network_settings_vpn_present_click_slider.png)

In the popup, click login.

??? question "How does that look like?"

    ![In the popup, click login](./img/ubuntu_connect_to_vpn_popup.png)

You are now asked for you UU Login:

??? question "How does that look like?"

    ![Fill in your UU login name and password](./img/ubuntu_connect_to_vpn_popup_click_login.png)

Fill in your UU login name and password.

??? question "How does that look like?"

    ![Filled in UU login name and password](./img/ubuntu_connect_to_vpn_popup_login_filled_in.png)

Fill in your 2FA. The 2FA should be called `[akka_id]`, e.g. `svesv314`
(and not `sven.svensson@icm.uu.se`).

???- question "Forgot how to set up 2FA for your UU user account?"

    UU describes how to setup 2FA for your user
    account [here](https://www.uu.se/en/staff/service-and-tools/tools-and-guides/log-in-securely).

    Pick the options for 'user account' (i.e. not for SharePoint).

??? question "How does that look like?"

    ![2FA filled in](./img/ubuntu_connect_to_vpn_popup_login_2fa_filled_in.png)

You are now connected!

??? question "How can I see that?"

    You are connected to the UU VPN according to network settings:

    ![You are connected to the UU VPN according to network settings](./img/ubuntu_network_connected_to_vpn.png)

    You are connected to the UU VPN according to the main menu:
