# SIMPLER project application

!!! info "SIMPLER is an abbreviation"

    SIMPLER is an abbreviation of
    'Swedish Infrastructure for Medical Population-based Life-course
    and Environmental Research'.
    It does not meant to indicate that this is easier.

To use an UPPMAX cluster, one [needs to apply to a project](project_apply.md).
This page describes how to apply for a SIMPLER project.
