# Setting up two factor authentication for UPPMAX

???- question "Prefer a video?"

    Watch [the YouTube video 'Get your UPPMAX 2FA'](https://youtu.be/eSn0kLkU5Dc)

Follow the guide [Setting up two factor authentication for UPPMAX](https://www.uu.se/en/centre/uppmax/get-started/2-factor).

After this procedure, it takes around 15 minutes before you can use
the 2FA to log in.

???- question "How do I know I used my new 2FA too early?"

    Simple answer: when you've used your new 2FA before having
    received an email.

    Another way to find out: go to <bianca.uppmax.uu.se>
    and try to use your new 2FA. You will get a 'Authentication failed'
    error when your new 2FA is not active yet.
