## Bianca's design

Bianca is an HPC cluster for sensitive data and is designed to:

- make accidental data leaks difficult
- make correct data management as easy as possible
- emulate the HPC cluster environment that SNIC users were familiar with
- provide a maximum amount of resources
- satisfy regulations

???- info "The Bianca architecture"

    ![The Bianca architecure](./img/bianca_architecture.png)

    > Bianca's architecture.
    > Red shows the university networks.
    > Blue shows the whole cluster, with hundreds of nodes.
    > Green shows virtual project clusters.
    > Yellow shows where file transfer occurs.

Bianca's architecture reflects that 
she is an HPC cluster for sensitive data:
the whole Bianca cluster has hundreds 
of virtual project clusters, 
each of which is isolated from each other and the Internet.
File transfer is only possible through the the so-called 'wharf', 
which is a special file area that is visible from the Internet.

!!! info "Bianca has no internet"

    - You *can* log in, but with extra steps
    - You *can* transfer files, but with extra steps
    - We recommend using the remote desktop login, see [here](here.md)

As Bianca is an HPC cluster that should be as easy to 
use as possible, there are two ways to interact with Bianca:
one more visual, the other a command-line environment.
Both environments are shown below.

As Bianca has sensitive data, there are constraints on how to
access Bianca.

One such constraint in accessing Bianca, 
is that one has to be within the university
networks, as described at [get within the university networks](#get-within-the-university-networks).

Another such constraint, is that data can be
transferred to or from a virtual project cluster through the so-called 'wharf', 
which is a special file area that is visible from the Internet.
File transfer is described in more detail [here](../cluster_guides/transfer_bianca.md).

## Prerequisites for using Bianca

To be allowed to use Bianca, one needs all of these:

- [An active research project](#an-active-research-project)
- [An UPPMAX account](#an-uppmax-account)
- [An UPPMAX password](#an-uppmax-password)

These prerequisites are discussed in detail below.

### An active research project

One [prerequisite for using Bianca](#prerequisites-for-using-bianca)
is that you need to be a member of an active SNIC SENS 
or SIMPLER research project (these are called `sens[number]` or `simp[number]`, 
where `[number]` represent a number, for example `sens123456` or `simp123456`). 

???- question "Forgot your Bianca projects?"

    One easy way to see your Bianca projects is to use the
    Bianca remote desktop login screen at <https://bianca.uppmax.uu.se/>.

    ![](./img/bianca_remote_desktop_login_shows_sens_projects.png)

[SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se/) (the 'Swedish User and Project Repository')
is the website that allows one to request access to Bianca
and to get an overview of the requested resources.

???- question "How does the SUPR website look like?"

    ![](./img/supr_first_page.png)

    > First SUPR page

    ![](./img/supr_2fa.png)

    > SUPR 2FA login. Use the SUPR 2FA (i.e. **not** UPPMAX)

After logging in, the [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se/) 
website will show all projects you are a member of,
under the 'Projects' tab.

???- question "How does the 'Projects' tab of the SUPR website look like?"

    ![](./img/supr_projects.png)

    > Example overview of SUPR projects

To see if a project has access to Bianca, click on the
project and scroll to the 'Resources' section. In the 'Compute' subsection,
there is a table. Under 'Resource' it should state 'Bianca @ UPPMAX'.

???- question "How does the 'Resources' page of an example project look like?"

    ![](./img/supr_project_sens2023598_resources.png)

    > The 'Resources' page of an example project.

Note that the 'Accounts' tab can be useful to verify your username.

???- question "How does the 'Accounts' tab help me find my username?"

    ![](./img/supr_accounts.png)

    > An example of a SUPR 'Accounts' tab. 
    > The example user has username `richel-sens2023598`,
    > which means his/her UPPMAX username is `richel`

You can become a member of an active SNIC SENS by:

- request membership to an existing project in SUPR
- create a project. See the UPPMAX page on 
  how to submit a project application [here](project_apply.md)

### An UPPMAX user account

Another [prerequisite for using Bianca](#prerequisites-for-using-bianca)
is that you must have a personal UPPMAX user account. 
This is separate from your SUPR account. 
See the user account application page if you do not have one. 

Once you are set up for login, 
this should also be reflected in SUPR through
 one or several additional account(s) 
at UPPMAX for the specific project(s) you are a member of.

### An UPPMAX password

Another [prerequisite for using Bianca](#prerequisites-for-using-bianca)
is that you need to know your UPPMAX password. 
If you change it, it may take up to an hour before changes are reflected in Bianca.

For advice on handling sensitive personal data correctly on Bianca, see our FAQ page.

## The two Bianca environments

Bianca, like most HPC clusters, uses Linux.
To use Bianca, there are two environments:

???- question "How does the Bianca remote desktop look like?"

    One can pick multiple remote desktop environments,
    such as GNOME and XFCE (and KDE, don't pick KDE!).

    ![The Bianca remote desktop](./img/bianca_remote_desktop.png)

    > The Bianca XFCE remote desktop environment

    ![A more populated Bianca remote desktop](./img/Thinlinc2.jpg)

    > A more populated Bianca XFCE remote desktop

- A remote desktop environment, also called 'graphical environment', 
  'GUI environment', 'ThinLinc environment'

???- question "How does the Bianca console environment look like?"

    ![The Bianca console environment](./img/login_bianca_via_terminal_terminal.png)

    > The Bianca console environment

- A console environment, also called 'terminal environment' or 'terminal'

The remote desktop environment is considered the easier place to start for most
new users, as it has most similarities with what a new user is familiar with.
However, one must always use a terminal to some extent.

## Get within the university networks

Bianca has sensitive data. 
To protect this data, 
Bianca is accessible from all Swedish university networks.
To be precise, to connect to Bianca one needs to so from a
[SUNET](https://www.sunet.se/) Internet Protocol ('IP') address.

Due to this, the first step to access Bianca
is to get an IP that is inside SUNET first. 

See the 'get inside the university networks' page [here](../getting_started/get_inside_sunet.md)

## Get inside the Bianca environment

### Login to the Bianca remote desktop environment

As Bianca is an HPC cluster for sensitive data,
one needs to be within SUNET to be able to access her.

???- question "Forgot how to get within SUNET?"

    See the 'get inside the university networks' page [here](../getting_started/get_inside_sunet.md)

Bianca does not support any so-called X-forwarding (unlike Rackham), 
so instead UPPMAX maintains a website that uses
ThinLinc to get a full remote desktop environment.
All you should need is a rather modern browser on any platform:
we have tested on Chrome and Firefox :-)

???- question "How does it look like to try to access a remote desktop from outside of SUNET?"

    ![](./img/login_uppmax_bianca_website_outside_sunet_browser_short.png)

    > When accessing the Bianca UPPMAX login website from outside of SUNET,
    > nothing will appear in your browser.

When inside SUNET, one can access a remote desktop environment
using a website:

#### 1. Go to [https://bianca.uppmax.uu.se](https://bianca.uppmax.uu.se)

In your web browser, go to [https://bianca.uppmax.uu.se](https://bianca.uppmax.uu.se).

???- question "How does it look like when outside of SUNET?"

    [Here](https://youtu.be/W-PMTyNcbYI?si=9oQP29a7OLo3mVrt&t=160) you can
    see how this looks like when outside of SUNET. 
    
    Spoiler: quite dull, as nothing happens until these is a timeout.

#### 2. Fill in the first dialog

Fill in the first dialog. 

Do use the `UPPMAX` [2-factor authentication](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/support/user-guides/setting-up-two-factor-authentication/) (i.e. not SUPR!)

???- question "How do I setup 2-factor authentication?"

    See the guide at [2-factor authentication](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/support/user-guides/setting-up-two-factor-authentication/)
    to setup an UPPMAX 2-factor authentication method.

    You really need to use the UPPMAX 2-factor authentication,
    i.e not the SUPR one, to login to Bianca.

???- question "How does that web page look like?"

    ![Bianca login, first dialog](./img/bianca_gui_login_1st.png)

    > The first page of [https://bianca.uppmax.uu.se](https://bianca.uppmax.uu.se)

Sometimes a webpage will be shown that asks you to wait. 
Simply do that :-)

???- question "How does that web page look like?"

    ![](/img/login_uppmax_bianca_website_create_login_node.png)

    > No Thinlinc Web Access active
    > The login node for your project cluster is probably asleep. Boot initiated. The startup can take from 2 to 8 minutes.
    >
    > This page will attempt to automatically reload. If nothing happens even after multiple minutes, you can do so manually. It is a bit more controlled in text mode.
    >
    > When this takes long, your original second factor code might expire. In that scenario, you'll be redirected to the first login page again.

    This is the webpage that shpws when a login node needs to be created. 

#### 3. Fill in the second dialog, using your regular password

Fill in the second dialog, using your regular password (i.e. no need for two-factor authentication).

???- question "How does that web page look like?"

    ![Bianca login, second dialog](./img/bianca_gui_login_2nd.png)

    > The second Bianca remote desktop login dialog. 
    > Note that it uses ThinLinc to establish this connection

#### 4. Picking a remote desktop flavor, but not KDE

When picking a remote desktop flavor, pick GNOME or XFCE, avoid picking KDE.

???- question "How does that look like?"

    ![](./img/remote_desktop_thinlinc_profile_chooser.png)

    > Here you are told you will need to pick a remote desktop flavor

    > Here you are asked to pick a remote desktop flavor, 
    > with Xfce as the default.
    > Pick any, except KDE.

!!! warning "Avoid choosing KDE"

    Avoid choosing the KDE desktop, as it gives problems when running interactive sessions.

    Instead, we recommend GNOME or XFCE.
     
#### 5. You are in!

Enjoy! You are in!

???- question "How does the remote desktop look like?"

    ![The Bianca remote desktop](./img/bianca_remote_desktop.png)

    > The Bianca remote desktop

???- tip "Video: using VPN and access the remote desktop"

    This video shows how to use an installed VPN,
    after which the UPPMAX Bianca login website is used to
    access the Bianca remote desktop environment: 
    [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Ni9nyCf7me8), 
    [download (.mp4)](https://richelbilderbeek.nl/login_bianca_vpn.mp4)

Under the hidden tab in the left edge of the screen, 
you can find a clipboard, 
icons of some special keys
and the disconnect button:

- the clipboard is needed to be able to copy-paste text to/from Bianca.
- the icons of some special keys are needed for some users, 
  as not all keyboard keys reach Bianca as expected.
- the disconnect button disconnects your session

???- question "What is the difference between 'disconnect session' and 'end session'?"

    'disconnect session' will save the current state of your session.
    When you connect again, you will get the remote desktop back 
    in exactly in the same place you left the system.
    For example: if you were editing a file before disconnecting, 
    your prompt will be in the same place you left it. 

    'end session' will not save the current state of your session.
    Instead, you will start with a clean slate at the next login.

Bianca has a automatically disconnect after 30 minutes of inactivity.
In the future it is possible that we implement some kind 
of "automatic log out from active graphical session".

### Login to the Bianca console environment

When inside SUNET, one can access a Bianca console environment
using a terminal and the Secure Shell Protocol (SSH).

???- question "Forgot how to get within SUNET?"

    See the 'get inside the university networks' page [here](../getting_started/get_inside_sunet.md)

You can use your favorite terminal to login (see <https://uppmax.github.io/uppmax_intro/login2.html#terminals> for an overview of many)
to the Bianca command-line environment. 
You can also have multiple log-ins active at once.

There are multiple ways to set this up:

- [Using an SSH password](#login-to-the-bianca-console-environment-using-an-ssh-password).
- [Using SSH keys](#login-to-the-Bianca-console-environment-using-ssh-keys)

Using an SSH password is considered easiest,
where using an SSH key is considered more elegant.

In a Bianca console environment:

- Text display is limited to 50kBit/s.
  This means that if you create a lot of text output,
  you will have to wait some time before you get your prompt back.
- Cut, copy and paste work as usual.
  Be careful to not copy-paste sensitive data!

### Login to the Bianca console environment using an SSH password

When inside SUNET, one can access a Bianca console environment
using SSH with an SSH password.

???- question "Forgot how to get within SUNET?"

    See the 'get inside the university networks' page [here](../getting_started/get_inside_sunet.md)

This is considered the easier one to setup,
but one will have to type a password twice to login.
To get rid of one password and setup SHH keys, 
see [here](#login-to-the-Bianca-console-environment-using-ssh-keys).


#### 1. Use `ssh` to log in

From a terminal, use [`ssh`](../software/ssh.md) to log in:

```bash
ssh [user]-[project name]@bianca.uppmax.uu.se
```

For example:

```bash
ssh sven-sens2023598@bianca.uppmax.uu.se
```

???- question "How does it look like when outside of SUNET?"

    [Here](https://youtu.be/W-PMTyNcbYI?si=iYxNToDb-EpTdnAO&t=79) you can
    see how this looks like when outside of SUNET. 
    
    Spoiler: quite dull, as nothing happens until these is a timeout.

???- question "Why no `-A`?"

    On Bianca, one can use `-A`:
   
    ```
    ssh -A username@bianca.uppmax.uu.se
    ```

    this option is only useful when 
    [using SSH keys](#login-to-the-Bianca-console-environment-using-ssh-keys)
    to access Bianca.
    As we here use passwords (i.e. no SSH keys) 
    to access Bianca, `-A` is unused
    and hence we simplify this documentation by omitting it.

???- question "Why no `-X`?"

    On Rackham, one can use `-X`:
   
    ```
    ssh -X username@rackham.uppmax.uu.se
    ```

    However, on Bianca, this so-called X-forwarding is disabled.
    Hence, we do not teach it :-)


#### 2. Type your UPPMAX password with 2FA

Type your UPPMAX password, 
directly followed by the UPPMAX 2-factor authentication number,
for example `verysecret678123`, then press enter.
In this case, the password is `verysecret` and `678123`
is the 2FA number.

After authenticated using the UPPMAX password and 2FA, 
you are logged in on Bianca's shared network,
on a so-called 'jumphost'. 

However, you will still need to login to your own
private virtual project cluster. 
As you are already properly authenticated (i.e. using an UPPMAX password
and UPPMAX 2FA), you don't need 2FA anymore.

???- question "What is a virtual project cluster?"

    As Bianca holds sensitive data, by regulations,
    each Bianca project must be isolated from each other
    and are not allowed to, for example, share the same memory.

    One way to achieve this, would be to build one HPC cluster 
    per project. While this would guarantee isolated project environments,
    this would be quite impractical.

    Instead, we create isolated project environments by using software,
    that creates so-called virtual clusters, as if they would be
    physical clusters. Like physical clusters, a virtual cluster 
    has a guaranteed isolated project environment.

When you login to Bianca's shared network,
you will get a message of your project's login node status.
It can be `up and running` or `down`.
If it is `down`, the virtual cluster is started,
which may take some minutes.

#### 3. Type your UPPMAX password

Type your UPPMAX password,
for example `verysecret`

#### 4. You are in!

Enjoy! You are in! Or, to be precise, 
you are on the login node of your own virtual project cluster.
By default, this node has one core,
hence if you need more memory or more CPU power, 
you submit a job (interactive or batch), 
and an idle node will be moved into your project cluster.

### Login to the Bianca console environment using SSH keys

When inside SUNET, one can access a Bianca console environment
using SSH and SSH keys.

???- question "Forgot how to get within SUNET?"

This is considered a bit harder to setup,
but one only needs to type one password to login to Bianca.
If you don't mind typing your UPPMAX password twice,
an easier setup is [here](#login-to-the-bianca-console-environment-using-an-ssh-password).

#### 1. Use `ssh` to log in

From a terminal, use [`ssh`](../software/ssh.md) to log in:

```bash
ssh -A [user]-[project name]@bianca.uppmax.uu.se
```

For example:

```bash
ssh -A sven-sens2023598@bianca.uppmax.uu.se
```

???- question "How does it look like when outside of SUNET?"

    [Here](https://youtu.be/W-PMTyNcbYI?si=iYxNToDb-EpTdnAO&t=79) you can
    see how this looks like when outside of SUNET. 
    
    Spoiler: quite dull, as nothing happens until these is a timeout.

???- question "Why no `-X`?"

    On Rackham, one can use `-X`:
   
    ```
    ssh -X username@rackham.uppmax.uu.se
    ```

    However, on Bianca, this so-called X-forwarding is disabled.
    Hence, we do not teach it :-)

#### 2. Type your UPPMAX password and 2FA

Type your UPPMAX password, 
directly followed by the UPPMAX 2-factor authentication number,
for example `verysecret678123`, then press enter.
In this case, the password is `verysecret` and `678123`
is the 2FA number.

### 3. You are in!

Enjoy! You are in!

???- question "Why does one need two passwords?"

    The first password is needed to get into the shared Bianca environment.
    This password contains both an UPPMAX password and an UPPMAX 2FA number.

    The second password is needed to go to the login node 
    of a project's virtual cluster.
