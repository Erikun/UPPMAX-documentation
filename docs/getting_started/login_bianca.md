![The Bianca environments](./img/bianca_environments_926_x_261.png)

> The two Bianca environments to work on Bianca.
> At the left is a remote desktop environment.
> At the the right is the console environment.

There are multiple UPPMAX clusters one can [log in to](../getting_started/login.md).
Here it is described how to log in to [Bianca](../cluster_guides/bianca.md):

- [Prerequisites](bianca_usage_prerequisites.md) describes what is needed before one can access Bianca
- [The two Bianca environments](#the-two-bianca-environments) shows the two ways to access Bianca:
    - For a remote desktop environment, go to [access Bianca remote desktop environment via a website](login_bianca_remote_desktop_website.md)
    - For a console environment, go to [login to the Bianca console environment with a password](login_bianca_console_password.md).
      If you want to get rid of using a password every time, see [login to the Bianca console environment with an SSH key](login_bianca_console_ssh_key.md)

## The two Bianca environments

There are two ways to access Bianca:

Login                |Description
---------------------|----------------------------------------------
Website              |Remote desktop, no installation needed, slow
Terminal             |Console environment, recommended

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  need_gui(Need to run a graphical program?)
  how_login(How to log in?)
  use_terminal[Use a terminal]
  use_website[Use the remote desktop website]

  use_password[Use password\nStart here]
  use_ssh_keys[Use SSH keys\nNo more password needed]

  need_gui --> |no| use_terminal
  need_gui --> |yes| use_website

  use_terminal --> how_login
  how_login --> use_password
  how_login --> use_ssh_keys
```

???- question "How does the Bianca remote desktop look like?"

    One can pick multiple remote desktop environments,
    such as GNOME and XFCE (and KDE, don't pick KDE!).

    ![The Bianca remote desktop](./img/bianca_remote_desktop.png)

    > The Bianca XFCE remote desktop environment

    ![A more populated Bianca remote desktop](../software/img/thinlinc_local_bianca.jpg)

    > A more populated Bianca XFCE remote desktop

- A remote desktop environment, also called 'graphical environment',
  'GUI environment', '[ThinLinc](../software/thinlinc.md) environment'

???- question "How does the Bianca console environment look like?"

    ![The Bianca console environment](./img/login_bianca_via_terminal_terminal.png)

    > The Bianca console environment

- A console environment, also called 'terminal environment' or 'terminal'

The remote desktop environment is considered the easier place to start for most
new users, as it has most similarities with what a new user is familiar with.
However, one must always use a terminal to some extent.

- For a remote desktop environment, go to [access Bianca remote desktop environment via a website](login_bianca_remote_desktop_website.md)
- For a console environment, go to [login to the Bianca console environment with a password](login_bianca_console_password.md).
  If you want to get rid of using a password every time, see [login to the Bianca console environment with an SSH key](login_bianca_console_ssh_key.md)

???- question "Will a local ThinLinc client work too?"

    No.

    One really can only [access Bianca remote desktop environment via a website](login_bianca_remote_desktop_website.md).

After login, you will be on a [login node](../cluster_guides/login_node.md).

!!! note "How to behave on a login node"

    On a login node, one can and should do simple things only:
    it is a resource shared with all other users on that node.

    If you need to do more intense calculations,
    [use the Slurm job scheduler](../cluster_guides/slurm_on_rackham.md).

    If you need to do more intense calculations interactively,
    [use an interactive node](../cluster_guides/start_interactive_node_on_rackham.md).
