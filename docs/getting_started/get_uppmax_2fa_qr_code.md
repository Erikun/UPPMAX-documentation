# Setting up the QR code for two factor authentication for UPPMAX 

Once you have the new account, you should get one time codes for it when you
have it selected.
To finish the registration at UPPMAX, you need to enter the code
that is displayed in the field where it says "Code:" and submit.
The codes will change over time, don't worry about this,
you just need to use whatever code is current.

Once you have entered and submitted the current code,
you should see a final page:

![The final page](./img/get_uppmax_2fa_qr_code.png)

When you see that page, it will take a little while and the token will
be activated (you should also receive an e-mail about the new token).
