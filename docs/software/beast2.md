# BEAST2

BEAST2 is a tool for Bayesian phylogenetic analysis.

???- question "Is BEAST2 a new version of BEAST?"

    No.

    Although BEAST and BEAST2 achieve a similar goal,
    BEAST and BEAST2 are developed independently.

    Hence:

    - there are things BEAST can do that BEAST2 cannot, and vice versa
    - one cannot create a BEAST XML file and expect BEAST2 to be able to run it, and vice versa

## Using BEAST2

Here is how to use BEAST2 on the UPPMAX clusters.

???- question "Prefer a video?"

    [This YouTube video](https://youtu.be/Z6LcFE5p5S0) shows
    how to use BEAST2 on the UPPMAX clusters.

## 1. Load a `beast2` module

First step is to load a BEAST2 module.

Here is how to find the BEAST2 versions on the UPPMAX clusters:

```bash
module spider beast2
```

When loading a BEAST2 module, also load `bioinfo-tools`:

```bash
module load bioinfo-tools beast2/2.7.4
```

???- question "How does that look like?"

    ```bash
    $ module load bioinfo-tools beast2/2.7.4
    beast2/2.7.4: Also loaded beagle/4.0.0
    beast2/2.7.4: Many Beast packages are available, to see the list, 'packagemanager -list'
    beast2/2.7.4: Use BEAST_XMX to specify the amount of RAM (default 5g), 'export BEAST_XMX=15g'. Do not exceed RAM available to your job.
    ```

## 2. Run `BEAUti`

Next step is to create a BEAST2 configuration file
using `BEAUti`. This graphical tool can be started using:

```bash
beauti
```

As `BEAUti` is a graphical program,
it needs [SSH with X forwarding enabled](../software/ssh_x_forwarding.md) enabled.

???- question "How does that look like?"

    Starting `BEAUti` results in the following pop-up window:

    ![BEAUti](./img/beauti.png)

After using `BEAUti`, save the file with your BEAST2 model.

## 3. Run

A BEAST2 run takes a lot of computing power,
hence do not run it on a login node.
Instead, run it on an interactive session
or use a script.

???- question "How to start an interactive session?"

    View the UPPMAX documentation
    ['How to start an interactive session on Rackham'](../cluster_guides/start_interactive_session_on_rackham.md).

On an interactive session, run BEAST2 on the saved BEAST2 model:

```bash
beast beast2_setup.xml
```

When using a script, put that line in a script.
Below is an example script, called `run_beast2.sh`:

```bash title="run_beast2.sh"
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -A uppmax2023-2-25
module load bioinfo-tools beast2/2.7.4
beast beast2_setup.xml
```

- In line 2, replace `uppmax2023-2-25` with [your UPPMAX project](../getting_started/project.md).
- In line 3, you may want to replace `beast2/2.7.4` with your favorite BEAST2 version

Then run this script using `sbatch run_beast2.sh`.

Note that this is a *minimal* script.
See [the UPPMAX documentation on Slurm](../cluster_guides/slurm.md)
for ways to improve this script.

## View the trees using DensiTree

DensiTree is a tool that allows one to display the posterior tree distribution
of a BEAST2 run.

Run:

```bash
densitree [trees_filename]
```

where `[trees_filename]` is the name of the file containing the posterior trees,
resulting in, for example, `densitree my_file.trees`.

![Densitree](./img/densitree.png)

## Run Tracer

[Tracer](tracer.md) is a tool to analyse the results of a
([BEAST](beast.md) or) [BEAST2](beast2.md) run.

See [Tracer](tracer.md) how to use [Tracer](tracer.md).

![Tracer](./img/tracer.png)

## Show info

```bash
beast -beagle_info
```

???- "How does that look like?"

    Here the command is run on a [Rackham](../cluster_guides/rackham.md)
    compute node, using an interactive session.

    Here an interactive session with 1 node:

    ```bash
    interactive -A uppmax2023-2-25 -M snowy -N 1 -n 16 --exclusive -t 1-00:00:00
    ```

    ```console
    [sven@s93 ~]$ beast -beagle_info

## Troubleshooting

### BEAUti gives `BadAlloc`

- Platform(s): MacOS

This problem seems to be related to not having a proper X server installed.
In this case, [SSH X forwarding](ssh_x_forwarding.md) works to the extent
that SSH is able to show [`xeyes`](../software/xeyes.md), yet fails to show BEAUti.
Also, [using the remote desktop via a ThinLinc client](../getting_started/login_rackham_remote_desktop_local_thinlinc_client.md) fails.

A solution may be to [use the remote desktop via the web](../getting_started/login_rackham_remote_desktop_website.md)

???- question "How does that look like?"

    Here is how it looks like:

    ```console
    [kayakhi@rackham2 ~]$ xeyes

    [kayakhi@rackham2 ~]$ module load bioinfo-tools beast2/2.7.4

    beast2/2.7.4: Also loaded beagle/4.0.0

    beast2/2.7.4: Many Beast packages are available, to see the list, 'packagemanager -list'

    beast2/2.7.4: Use BEAST_XMX to specify the amount of RAM (default 5g), 'export BEAST_XMX=15g'. Do not exceed RAM available to your job.

    [kayakhi@rackham2 ~]$ beauti

    X Error of failed request:  BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)

      Major opcode of failed request:  149 (GLX)

      Minor opcode of failed request:  5 (X_GLXMakeCurrent)

      Serial number of failed request:  0

      Current serial number in output stream:  32
    ```

    Note that this user has enabled [SSH X forwarding](ssh_x_forwarding.md),
    as is proven by calling `xeyes` without problems.
