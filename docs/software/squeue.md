# `squeue`

The [job scheduler](../cluster_guides/slurm.md) consists of many
programs to manage jobs.
`squeue` is a tool to view information about the job queues.

## View all jobs

### View all jobs in the Bianca or Rackham queue

View all jobs in the [Bianca](../cluster_guides/bianca.md) or [Rackham](../cluster_guides/rackham.md) queue:

```bash
squeue
```

???- question "How does that look like?"

    Your output will be similar to this:

    ```bash
    [sven@rackham1 ~]$ squeue | head -n 1; squeue | shuf | head
                 JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)

### View all jobs in Snowy queue

View all jobs in the [Snowy](../cluster_guides/snowy.md) queue:

```bash
squeue -M snowy
```

???- question "How does that look like?"

    Your output will be similar to this:

    ```bash
    [sven@rackham1 ~]$ squeue -M snowy
