# squeue

`squeue` is a tool to view information about [Slurm](../cluster_guides/slurm.md) job queues.

View all jobs in the queue:

```bash
squeue
```

???- question "How does that look like?"

    Your output will be similar to this:

    ```bash
    [richel@rackham1 ~]$ squeue | head -n 1; squeue | shuf | head
                 JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)

View your jobs in the queue:

```bash
squeue -u $USER
```

???- question "How does that look like?"

    Your output will be similar to this, when you have no jobs in the queue:

    ```bash
    [richel@rackham1 ~]$ squeue -u $USER
                 JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
    ```
