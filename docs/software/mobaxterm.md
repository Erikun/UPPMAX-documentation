# MobaXterm

There are multiple [SSH clients](ssh_client.md).
This page describes the MobaXterm [SSH clients](ssh_client.md).

MobaXterm is an SSH client that is easy to use and install for Windows.
When MobaXterm is started, start a [terminal](../software/terminal.md) to run `ssh`.
The usage of `ssh` is described at the UPPMAX page on `ssh` [here](ssh.md).

In MobaXterm you can use the internal `MobAgent` or/and the `Peagent`
from the `PuTTy` tools.
