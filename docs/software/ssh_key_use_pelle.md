# Create and use an SSH key pair for Pelle

!!! warning "Does not work yet"

    [Pelle](../cluster_guides/pelle.md) is a new UPPMAX HPC cluster
    that is in the process of being deployed.

    The procedure as described on this page does not work yet or is untested.

    This page will be updated when this works.

This page describes [how to create and use an SSH key](ssh_key_use.md)
for the [Pelle](../cluster_guides/pelle.md) cluster.

## Procedure

???- question "Prefer a video?"

    - [Create and use an SSH key pair for Pelle when outside of SUNET (fails!)](https://youtu.be/-f0C66zIrwI)
    - [Create and use an SSH key pair for Pelle on Ubuntu 24.04 Noble (fails!)](https://youtu.be/j6F8sJu2NFs)

This figure shows the procedure:

    add[2.Add your keys to an SSH agent]
    copy[3.Copy the public key to Pelle]
  end
  create --> add
  add --> copy
```

This procedure will fail if:

- You are outside of the university networks,
  see [how to get inside the university networks](../getting_started/get_inside_sunet.md).
  [This video](https://youtu.be/-f0C66zIrwI) shows it will fail when being
  outside of the university networks
- You use Ubuntu 24.04 Noble, as demonstrated by [this video](https://youtu.be/j6F8sJu2NFs),
  where a password is still requested after doing this procedure

### 1. Create an SSH key pair

Create an SSH key pair with the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -a 100 -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_uppmax_login -C "My comment"
```

- `-a 100`:  100 rounds of key derivations, making your key's password harder to brute-force, as is recommended [here](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/144044)
- `-t ed25519`: type of encryption scheme
- `-f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_uppmax_login`: specify filename, following the naming scheme as suggested [here](https://superuser.com/a/1261644)
- `-C "My comment"`: a comment that will be stored in the key, so you can find out what it was for

### 2. Add your keys to an SSH agent

Add your newly generated `ed25519` key to an SSH agent:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_uppmax_login
```

### 3. Copy the public key to Pelle

Copy the public key to Pelle or other server.

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_ed25519_uppmax_login.pub [username]@pelle.uppmax.uu.se
```

- `-i .ssh/id_ed25519_uppmax_login.pub`: the identity file, the public key's filename
- `[username]@pelle.uppmax.uu.se`: your UPPMAX username, for example `sven@pelle.uppmax.uu.se`

After this, you can login to Pelle without specifying a password.

## Troubleshooting

### On Linux, it still asks for a password

From [this post](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/26371/ssh-prompts-for-password-despite-ssh-authorized-keys)
and [its answer](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/664213):

On Pelle, do:

```bash
chmod 700 .ssh/authorized_keys 
chmod 700 .ssh
chmod 700 ~
```

On your local computer, do:

```bash
chmod 700 .ssh/authorized_keys 
chmod 700 .ssh
chmod 700 ~
```
