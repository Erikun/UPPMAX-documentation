# Debuggers

There are debugging tools provided with each [compiler](compilers.md).

- [`gdb`, the GNU debugger](gdb.md): works well with C, C++, and Fortran programs
- [`idb`, the Intel debugger](idb.md) (obsolete, use [`gdb`](gdb.md) instead)
- `[some other compiler]`: works well with Fortran90/95 programs
