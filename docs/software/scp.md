# `scp`

The program `scp` allows you to transfer files to/from the UPPMAX HPC clusters
from a [md](terminal.md)

Although `scp` is an abbreviation of 'Secure copy protocol',
it is not considered 'secure' anymore:
instead, it is considered an outdated protocol:
[`rsync`](rsync.md) is a similar tool that is considered secure.

In general, using `scp` to copy files from a certain location to
another location, looks like this:

```bash
scp [from] [to]
```
