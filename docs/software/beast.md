# BEAST

BEAST is a tool for Bayesian phylogenetic analysis.

???- question "Is BEAST2 a new version of BEAST?"

    No.

    Although BEAST and BEAST2 achieve a similar goal,
    BEAST and BEAST2 are developed independently.

    Hence,
    - there are things BEAST can do that BEAST2 cannot, and vice versa
    - one cannot create a BEAST XML file and expect BEAST2 to be able to run it, and vice versa

## Run Tracer

[Tracer](tracer.md) is a tool to analyse the results of a
[BEAST](beast.md) (or [BEAST2](beast2.md)) run.

See [Tracer](tracer.md) how to use [Tracer](tracer.md).
