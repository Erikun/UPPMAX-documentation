      CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:6 (cmake_policy):

        of CMake.
      
        The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all

                              If you are seeing this warning it is very likely that a setuptools
                              plugin or customization overrides the `build_py` command, without
                              taking into consideration how editable installs run build steps
                              starting from setuptools v64.0.0.
      
                              Plugin authors and developers relying on custom build steps are
                              encouraged to update their `build_py` implementation considering the
                              information about editable installs in
                              https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/extension.html.
      
                              For the time being `setuptools` will silence this error and ignore
                              the faulty command, but this behaviour will change in future versions.

      !!
      
              ********************************************************************************
              An error happened while installing `triton` in editable mode.
      
              The following steps are recommended to help debug this problem:
      
              - Try to install the project normally, without using the editable mode.
                Does the error still persist?
                (If it does, try fixing the problem before attempting the editable mode).
              - If you are using binary extensions, make sure you have all OS-level
                dependencies installed (e.g. compilers, toolchains, binary libraries, ...).
              - Try the latest version of setuptools (maybe the error was already fixed).
              - If you (or your project dependencies) are using any setuptools extension
                or customization, make sure they support the editable mode.
      
              After following the steps above, if the problem still persists and
              you think this is related to how setuptools handles editable installations,
              please submit a reproducible example
              (see https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) to:
      
                  https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues
