# Python programming

This page describes how to program in [Python](python.md)
on the [UPPMAX clusters](../cluster_guides/uppmax_cluster.md).

There are multiple ways to program in Python:

Description               |Features
--------------------------|------------------------------------------
Use a text editor         |Non-interactive, no help
Use the Python interpreter|Interactive, terminal-based, some help
Use IPython               |Interactive, terminal-based, more help and features
Use Jupyter               |Interactive, web-based

## Use a text editor

You can run a Python script in the shell by:

```console
$ python example_script.py 
```
or, if you loaded a `python3` module:

```console
$ python3 example_script.py 
```

### Use Python in an interactive session

You start a python session by typing:

```console
$ python
```

or

```console
$ python3
```

The python prompt looks like this:

```python
>>>
```
Exit with `<Ctrl-D>`, `quit()` or `exit()`.

## UPPMAX Python-related courses

There are these UPPMAX courses related to Python:

- [Introduction to Python](https://github.com/UPPMAX/uppmax_intro_python), which is one day of the [introduction to UPPMAX course](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/support/courses-and-workshops/introductory-course-summer-2023/) which takes four days in total  
- 1-day workshop 'Using Python in a HPC environment'
- 3-day course on Python, Julia and R
