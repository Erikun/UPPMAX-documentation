## Compiling and running parallel programs on UPPMAX clusters

### Introduction

These notes show by brief examples how to compile and run serial and parallel programs on the clusters at UPPMAX.

All programs are of the trivial "hello, world" type. The point is to demonstrate how to compile and execute the programs, not how to write parallel programs!

## Running serial programs on execution nodes

### Standard compatibility

- c11            gcc/4.8      intel/16+
- c17 (bug-fix)  gcc/8        intel/17+ 19 full
- Fortran2008    gcc/9        intel/15+ 18 full
- Fortran2018    gcc/9        intel/19+

### Examples

Jobs are submitted to execution nodes through the resource manager.
We use Slurm on our clusters.

We will use the hello program we wrote in the section [Compiling source code](compiling_serial.md). The program language should not matter here when we deal with serial programs.

To run the serial program hello as a batch job using Slurm, enter the following shell script in the file ``hello.sh``:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -l
# hello.sh :  execute hello serially in Slurm
# command: $ sbatch hello.sh
# sbatch options use the sentinel #SBATCH
# You must specify a project
#SBATCH -A your_project_name
#SBATCH -J serialtest
# Put all output in the file hello.out
#SBATCH -o hello.out
# request 5 seconds of run time
#SBATCH -t 0:0:5
# request one core
#SBATCH -p core -n 1
./hello
```

The last line in the script is the command used to start the program.

Submit the job to the batch queue:

```console
sbatch hello.sh
```

The program's output to stdout is saved in the file named at the -o flag.

```console
$ cat hello.out
hello, world
```

## MPI using the OpenMPI library

Before compiling a program for MPI we must choose, in addition to the compiler, which version of MPI we want to use. At UPPMAX there are two, openmpi and intelmpi. These, with their versions, are compatible only to a subset of the gcc and intel compiler versions.

!!! tip

    Check this [compatibility page](parallel_comb.md) for a more complete picture of compatible versions.

### C programs using OpenMPI

Enter the following mpi program in c and save in the file hello.c

```c
/* hello-mpi.c :  mpi program in c printing a message from each process */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <mpi.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int npes, myrank;
    MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);
    MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &npes);
    MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &myrank);
    printf("From process %d out of %d, Hello World!\n", myrank, npes);
    MPI_Finalize();
    return 0;
}
```

Before compiling a program for MPI we must choose which version of MPI. At UPPMAX there are two, openmpi and intelmpi. For this example we will use openmpi.
To load the openmpi module, enter the command below or choose other versions according to the lists above.

```console
module load gcc/10.3.0 openmpi/3.1.6
```

To check that the openmpi modules is loaded, use the command:

```console
module list
```

The command to compile a c program for mpi is mpicc. Which compiler is used when this command is issued depends on what compiler module was loaded before openmpi

To compile, enter the command:

```console
mpicc -o hello-mpi hello-mpi.c
```

You should add optimization and other flags to the mpicc command, just as you would to the compiler used. So if the gcc compiler is used and you wish to compile an mpi program written in C with good, fast optimization you should use a command similar to the following:

```console
mpicc -fast -o hello-mpi hello-mpi.c
```

To run the mpi program hello using the batch system, we make a batch script with name ``hello-mpi.sh``

```bash
#!/bin/bash -l
# hello.sh :  execute parallel mpi program hello on Slurm
# use openmpi
# command: $ sbatch hello.sh
# Slurm options use the sentinel #SBATCH
#SBATCH -A your_project_name
#SBATCH -J mpitest
#SBATCH -o hello.out
#
# request 5 seconds of run time
#SBATCH -t 00:00:05
#SBATCH -p node -n 8
module load gcc/10.3 openmpi/3.1.3
mpirun ./hello-mpi
```

The last line in the script is the command used to start the program.
The last word on the last line is the program name hello.

Submit the job to the batch queue:

```console
sbatch hello-mpi.sh
```

The program's output to stdout is saved in the file named at the -o flag.
A test run of the above program yelds the following output file:

```bash
$ cat hello-mpi.out
From process 4 out of 8, Hello World!
From process 5 out of 8, Hello World!
From process 2 out of 8, Hello World!
From process 7 out of 8, Hello World!
From process 6 out of 8, Hello World!
From process 3 out of 8, Hello World!
From process 1 out of 8, Hello World!
From process 0 out of 8, Hello World!
```

### Fortran programs using OpenMPI

The following example program does numerical integration to find Pi (inefficiently, but it is just an example):

```fortran

program testampi
    implicit none
    include 'mpif.h'
    double precision :: h,x0,x1,v0,v1
    double precision :: a,amaster
    integer :: i,intlen,rank,size,ierr,istart,iend
    call MPI_Init(ierr)
    call MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD,size,ierr)
    call MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD,rank,ierr)
    intlen=100000000
    write (*,*) 'I am node ',rank+1,' out of ',size,' nodes.'

    h=1.d0/intlen
    istart=(intlen-1)*rank/size
    iend=(intlen-1)*(rank+1)/size
    write (*,*) 'start is ', istart
    write (*,*) 'end is ', iend
    a=0.d0
    do i=istart,iend
           x0=i*h
           x1=(i+1)*h
           v0=sqrt(1.d0-x0*x0)
           v1=sqrt(1.d0-x1*x1)
           a=a+0.5*(v0+v1)*h
    enddo
    write (*,*) 'Result from node ',rank+1,' is ',a
    call MPI_Reduce(a,amaster,1, &
             MPI_DOUBLE_PRECISION,MPI_SUM,0,MPI_COMM_WORLD,ierr)
    if (rank.eq.0) then
           write (*,*) 'Result of integration is ',amaster
           write (*,*) 'Estimate of Pi is ',amaster*4.d0
    endif
    call MPI_Finalize(ierr)
    stop
end program testampi
```

The program can be compiled by this procedure, using mpif90:

```console
module load intel/20.4 openmpi/3.1.6
mpif90 -Ofast -o testampi testampi.f90
```

The program can be run by creating a submit script sub.sh:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -l
# execute parallel mpi program in Slurm
# command: $ sbatch sub.sh
# Slurm options use the sentinel #SBATCH
#SBATCH -J mpitest
#SBATCH -A your_project_name
#SBATCH -o pi
#
# request 5 seconds of run time
#SBATCH -t 00:00:05
#
#SBATCH -p node -n 8
module load intel/20.4 openmpi/3.1.6

mpirun ./testampi
```

Submit it:

```console
sbatch sub.sh
```

## OpenMP

OpenMP uses threads that use shared memory. OpenMP is supported by both the gcc and intel compilers and in the c/c++ and Fortran languages. Don't mix with OpenMPI whis is an open source library for MPI. OpenMP is built in in all modern compiler libraries.

Depending on your preferences load the chosen compiler:

```console
module load gcc/12.1.0
```

or

```console
module load intel/20.4
```

### C programs using OpenMP

Enter the following openmp program in c and save in the file hello_omp.c

```c
/* hello.c :  openmp program in c printing a message from each thread */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>
int main()
{
      int nthreads, tid;
      #pragma omp parallel private(nthreads, tid)
      {
            nthreads = omp_get_num_threads();
            tid = omp_get_thread_num();
           printf("From thread %d out of %d, hello, world\n", tid, nthreads);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

To compile, enter the command (note the -fopenmp or -qopenmp flag depending on compiler):

```console
gcc -fopenmp -o hello_omp hello_omp.c
```

or

```console
icc qfopenmp -o hello_omp hello_omp.c
```

Also here you should add optimization flags such as -fast as appropriate.

To run the openMP program hello using the batch system, enter the following shell script in the file hello.sh:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -l
# hello.sh :  execute parallel openmp program hello on Slurm
# use openmp
# command: $ sbatch hello.sh
# Slurm options use the sentinel #SBATCH
#SBATCH -J omptest
#SBATCH -A your_project_name
#SBATCH -o hello.out
#
# request 5 seconds of run time
#SBATCH -t 00:00:05
#SBATCH -p node -n 8
uname -n
#Tell the openmp program to use 8 threads
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8
module load intel/20.4
# or gcc...
ulimit -s  $STACKLIMIT
./hello_omp
```

The last line in the script is the command used to start the program.

Submit the job to the batch queue:

```console
sbatch hello.sh
```

The program's output to stdout is saved in the file named at the -o flag.
A test run of the above program yelds the following output file:

```console
$ cat hello.out
r483.uppmax.uu.se
unlimited
From thread 0 out of 8, hello, world
From thread 1 out of 8, hello, world
From thread 2 out of 8, hello, world
From thread 3 out of 8, hello, world
From thread 4 out of 8, hello, world
From thread 6 out of 8, hello, world
From thread 7 out of 8, hello, world
From thread 5 out of 8, hello, world
```

### Fortran programs using OpenMP

Enter the following openmp program in Fortran and save in the file hello_omp.f90

```fortran
PROGRAM HELLO
INTEGER NTHREADS, TID, OMP_GET_NUM_THREADS, OMP_GET_THREAD_NUM
! Fork a team of threads giving them their own copies of variables
!$OMP PARALLEL PRIVATE(NTHREADS, TID)
! Obtain thread number
TID = OMP_GET_THREAD_NUM()
PRINT *, 'Hello World from thread = ', TID
! Only master thread does this
IF (TID .EQ. 0) THEN
 NTHREADS = OMP_GET_NUM_THREADS()
PRINT *, 'Number of threads = ', NTHREADS
END IF
! All threads join master thread and disband
!$OMP END PARALLEL
END
```

With gcc compiler:

```console
gfortran hello_omp.f90 -o hello_omp -fopenmp
```

and with Intel compiler:

```console
ifort hello_omp.f90 -o hello_omp -qopenmp
```

Run with:

```console
$ ./hello_omp

 Hello World from thread =            1
 Hello World from thread =            2
 Hello World from thread =            0
 Hello World from thread =            3
 Number of threads =            4
```

A batch file would look similar to the C version, above.

## Pthreads

Pthreads (Posix threads) are more low-level than openMP. That means that for a beginner it is easier to get rather expected gain only with a few lines with openMP. On the other hand it may be possible to gain more efficiency from your code with pthreads, though with quite some effort. Pthreads is native in c/c++. With additional installation of a POSIX library for Fortran it is possible to run it in there as well.

Enter the following program in c and save in the file hello_pthreads.c

```c
/* hello.c :  create system pthreads and print a message from each thread */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pthread.h>
// does not work for setting array length of "tid": const int NTHR = 8;
// Instead use "#define"
#define NTHR 8
int nt = NTHR, tid[NTHR];
pthread_attr_t attr;
void *hello(void *id)
{
     printf("From thread %d out of %d: hello, world\n", *((int *) id), nt);
     pthread_exit(0);
}
int main()
{
    int i, arg1;
    pthread_t thread[NTHR];
    /* system threads */
    pthread_attr_init(&attr);
    pthread_attr_setscope(&attr, PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM);
    /* create threads */
    for (i = 0; i < nt; i++) {
          tid[i] = i;
          pthread_create(&thread[i], &attr, hello, (void *) &tid[i]);
     }
    /* wait for threads to complete */
    for (i = 0; i < nt; i++)
            pthread_join(thread[i], NULL);
      return 0;
}
```

To compile, enter the commands

```console
module load gcc/10.2.0
gcc -pthread -o hello_pthread hello_pthread.c
```

To run the pthread program hello using the batch system, enter the following shell script in the file hello.sh:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -l
# hello.sh :  execute parallel pthreaded program hello on Slurm
# command: $ sbatch hello.sh
# Slurm options use the sentinel #SBATCH
#SBATCH -J pthread
#SBATCH -A your_project_name
#SBATCH -o hello.out
#
# request 5 seconds of run time
#SBATCH -t 00:00:05
# use openmp programming environment
# to ensure all processors on the same node
#SBATCH -p node -n 8
uname -n
./hello_pthread
```

The last line in the script is the command used to start the program.
Submit the job to the batch queue:

```console
sbatch hello.sh
```

The program's output to stdout is saved in the file named at the -o flag.
A test run of the above program yelds the following output file:

```console
$ cat hello.out
r483.uppmax.uu.se
From thread 0 out of 8: hello, world
From thread 4 out of 8: hello, world
From thread 5 out of 8: hello, world
From thread 6 out of 8: hello, world
From thread 7 out of 8: hello, world
From thread 1 out of 8: hello, world
From thread 2 out of 8: hello, world
From thread 3 out of 8: hello, world
```
