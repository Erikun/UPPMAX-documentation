> A terminal.

A terminal is a program that allows you to run commands.

???- question "How to copy-paste to/from a terminal?"

    This depends on the terminal you use, however,
    this is the most common options:

    Press `CTRL + SHIFT + C` for copt, `CTRL + SHIFT + V` for pasting.

???- question "What does all the stuff on the line I can type on mean?"

    The text at the start of the line you can type on,
    is called the command prompt.

???- question "What is the command prompt?"

    The command prompt indicates
    that the terminal is waiting for user input.

    Here is an example prompt:

    ```bash
    [sven@rackham2 my_folder]$ 
    ```

    - `[` and `]`: indicates the beginning and end of information
    - `sven`: the username
    - `@`: at which cluster
    - `rackham2`: the remote node's name,
      in this case Rackham's second login node
    - `my_folder`: (part of) the path of the user,
      in this case, a folder called `my_folder`.
      The indication `~` means that the user in the home folder
    - `$`: indicate to be ready for user input

    The node's name is useful to find out where you are:

    Name                    |Location
    ------------------------|---------------------------
    `rackham1` to `rackham4`|A Rackham login node
    `r1` and higher         |A Rackham compute node node
    `bianca`                |A Bianca login node
    `b1` and higher         |A Bianca compute node
