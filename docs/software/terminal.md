A terminal is a program that allows you to run commands.

???- question "How to copy-paste to/from a terminal?"

    This depends on the terminal you use, however,
    this is the most common options:

    Press `CTRL + SHIFT + C` for copt, `CTRL + SHIFT + V` for pasting.

???- question "What does all the stuff on the line I can type on mean?"

    The text at the start of the line you can type on,
    is called the command prompt. It indicates
    that the terminal is waiting for user input.

    Here is an example prompt:

    ```bash
    [sven@rackham2 my_folder]$ 
    ```

    - `[` and `]`: indicates the beginning and end of information
    - `sven`: the username
    - `@`: at which cluster
    - `rackham2`: at Rackhams second login node
    - `my_folder`: the user is in a folder called `my_folder`
    - `$`: indicate to be ready for user input
