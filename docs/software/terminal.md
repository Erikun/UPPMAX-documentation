A terminal is a program that allows you to run commands.

## What does all the stuff on the line I can type on mean?

The text at the start of the line you can type on,
is called the command prompt. It indicates
that the terminal is waiting for user input.

Here is an example prompt:

```bash
[sven@rackham2 my_folder]$ 
```

- `[` and `]`: indicates the beginning and end of information
- `sven`: the username
- `@`: at which cluster
- `rackham2`: at Rackhams second login node
- `my_folder`: the user is in a folder called `my_folder`
- `$`: indicate to be ready for user input
