# Data transfer to/from Pelle using SCP

!!! warning "Does not work yet"

    [Pelle](../cluster_guides/pelle.md) is a new UPPMAX HPC cluster
    that is in the process of being deployed.

    The procedure as described on this page does not work yet or is untested.

    This page will be updated when this works.

There are multiple ways to [transfer files to or from Pelle](../cluster_guides/transfer_pelle.md).

This page shows you how to do so using [`scp`](scp.md).

## Procedure

???- question "Prefer a video?"

    See this procedure as a video at [YouTube](https://youtu.be/tUr-gTXmpAA)

### 1. Start a terminal on your local computer

Start a [terminal](../software/terminal.md) on your local computer

### 2. Copy files using `scp`

In the terminal, copy files using [`scp`](scp.md) to connect to Pelle:

```bash
scp [from] [to]
```

Where `[from]` is the file(s) you want to copy, and `[to]` is the destination.
This is quite a shorthand notation!

This is how you copy a file from your local computer to Pelle:

```bash
scp [local_filename] [username]@pelle.uppmax.uu.se:/home/[username]
```

where `[local_filename]` is the path to a local filename,
and `[username]` is your UPPMAX username, for example:

```bash
scp my_file.txt sven@pelle.uppmax.uu.se:/home/sven
```

To copy a file from Pelle to your local computer,
do the command above in reverse order:

```bash
scp [username]@pelle.uppmax.uu.se:/home/[username]/[remote_filename] [local_folder]
```

where `[remote_filename]` is the path to a remote filename,
`[username]` is your UPPMAX username,
and `[local_folder]` is your local folder, for example:

```bash
scp sven@pelle.uppmax.uu.se:/home/sven/my_remote_file.txt /home/sven
```

### 3. If asked, give your UPPMAX password

If asked, give your UPPMAX password.
You can get rid of this prompt if you have setup SSH keys
