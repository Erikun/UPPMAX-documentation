# Jupyter in local browser

To increase the speed of graphics it is possible to run Jupyter on a compute
node, but using the graphics on your local computer.
That will speed up the interaction with plotting figures and GUI management.

This possible for the [Rackham[(../cluster_guides/rackham.md) and
[Snowy](../cluster_guides/snowy.md) clusters.

!!! warning

    This feature is not possible for Bianca

## Step 1: Login to an UPPMAX cluster

- Using ThinLinc or a [terminal](../software/terminal.md) does not matter.

## Step 2: start an interactive session

Start a terminal. Within that terminal, start an interactive session from the login node (change to the correct NAISS project ID).

### For Rackham

```sh
interactive -A <naiss-project-id>  -t 4:00:00
```

### For Snowy

```sh
interactive -M snowy -A <naiss-project-id>  -t 4:00:00
```

## Step 3: start Jupyter in the interactive session

Within your terminal with the interactive session, load a modern Python module:

```sh
module load python/3.11.8
```

Then, start ``jupyter-notebook`` (or ``jupyter-lab``):

```sh
jupyter-notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser
```

Leave this terminal open.

The terminal will display multiple URLs.

Copy one of these, like:

```text
http://r486:8888/?token=5c3aeee9fbfc75f7a11c4a64b2b5b7ec49622231388241c2
```

## Step 4: On own computer

- If you use ssh to connect to Rackham, you need to forward the port of the interactive session to your local computer.
    - On Linux or Mac this is done by running in another terminal. Make sure you have the ports changed if they are not at the default ``8888``.

```sh
ssh -L 8888:r486:8888 username@rackham.uppmax.uu.se
```

- Replace ``r486`` if you got another node
- If you use Windows it may be better to do this in the PowerShell instead of a WSL2 terminal.
- If you use PuTTY - you need to change the settings in "Tunnels" accordingly (could be done for the current connection as well).

[SSH port forwarding](https://uplogix.com/docs/local-manager-user-guide/advanced-features/ssh-port-forwarding)

On your computer open the address you got but replace ``r486`` with ``localhost`` or ``127.0.0.0`` i.e.

```text
http://localhost:8888/?token=5c3aeee9fbfc75f7a11c4a64b2b5b7ec49622231388241c2
```

or

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=5c3aeee9fbfc75f7a11c4a64b2b5b7ec49622231388241c2
```

This should bring the jupyter interface on your computer and all calculations and files will be on Rackham compute node.
