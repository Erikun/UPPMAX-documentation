# `xeyes`

![`xeyes` in action](./img/eyes.png)

`xeyes` is a program that shows two eyes. The `x` in its name refers
to the X11 display server, which is one of many ways to display
graphics on screen.

`xeyes` is used mostly diagnostically, i.e. to find
out if one used [SSH with X-forwaring](ssh_x_forwarding.md).
When `xeyes` is run, but does not show the eyes, it means
that [SSH with X-forwaring](ssh_x_forwarding.md) does not work.
