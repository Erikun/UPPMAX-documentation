# TensorFlow

TensorFlow is a library for machine learning and artificial intelligence.

TensorFlow is available in multiple variants:

- [TensorFlow as a Python package for CPU](#tensorflow-as-a-python-package-for-cpu):
  works on [Rackham](../cluster_guides/rackham.md)
- [TensorFlow as a Python package for GPU](#tensorflow-as-a-python-package-for-gpu)
  works on [Bianca](../cluster_guides/bianca.md) and [Snowy](../cluster_guides/snowy.md)

## TensorFlow as a Python package for CPU

TensorFlow as a Python package for CPU 
that works on [Rackham](../cluster_guides/rackham.md).

It is part of the `python_ML_packages/[version]-cpu` 
[modules](../cluster_guides/modules.md), where `[version]` is a version,
for example, `python_ML_packages/3.11.8-cpu`.

???- question "How to test TensorFlow as a Python package for CPU?"

    On Rackham, load the module to get access to the library:

    ```console
    module load python_ML_packages/3.11.8-cpu
    ```

    Start Python:

    ```console
    python
    ```

    In Python, type:

    ```python
    import tensorflow as tf
    print(tf.test.is_gpu_available())
    ```

    This should print:

    ```python
    False
    ```

    The output is correct: this is the CPU version.

## TensorFlow as a Python package for GPU

TensorFlow as a Python package for GPU that works on [Bianca](../cluster_guides/bianca.md) and [Snowy](../cluster_guides/snowy.md).


It is part of the `python_ML_packages/[version]-gpu` 
[modules](../cluster_guides/modules.md), where `[version]` is a version,
for example, `python_ML_packages/3.9.5-gpu`

:warning: You can load this package on nodes withpout GPU but python will not find Tensorflow!

If you want to work interactively and test things, first allocate resources as seen below: 

**On Snowy**

```console
$ interactive -A <proj> -n 2 -M snowy --gres=gpu:1  -t 1:00:01
```

**On Bianca**

```console
$ interactive -A <proj> -n 1 -C gpu --gres=gpu:1 -t 01:10:00 
```


???- question "How to test TensorFlow as a Python package for GPU?"

   Load the module to get access to the library:

    ```
    module load python_ML_packages/3.9-5-gpu
    ```

    Start Python:

    ```console
    python
    ```

    In Python, type:

    ```python
    import tensorflow as tf
    print(tf.test.is_gpu_available())
    ```

    This should print something like:

    ```python
    2024-03-15 14:13:02.038401: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1525] Created device /device:GPU:0 with 13614 MB memory:  -> device: 0, name: Tesla T4, pci bus id: 0000:08:00.0, compute capability: 7.5
    True
    ```

    The output is correct: this is the GPU version.
