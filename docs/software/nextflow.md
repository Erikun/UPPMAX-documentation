## `nf-core` from the module system

[https://nf-co.re](https://nf-co.re)
> `nf-core` and and all other required modules are available on the `transit` server as well.

```bash
module load bioinfo-tools
module load nf-core   # this also load the nextflow and java as requirements
```

## `nf-core` pipelines on Bianca

<!-- Due to the combination of indented code (that needs to be surrounded by -->
<!-- empty lines and a numbered list (that needs no empty lines), there -->
<!-- is no way to satisfy markdownlint -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 -->

1. Login to `transit.uppmax.uu.se` - [documentation](../cluster_guides/transfer_bianca.md#transit-server)
2. Mount the `wharf` of your project.

    ```bash
    user@transit:~$ mount_wharf sens2023531
    Mounting wharf (accessible for you only) to /home/<user>/sens2023531
    Password: 
    Second factor (TOTP UPPMAX): 
    done.
    ```

3. Navigate to your `wharf` folder
4. Disable Singularity cache

    ```bash
    export SINGULARITY_DISABLE_CACHE=true
    export APPTAINER_DISABLE_CACHE=true
    unset NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR
    ```

5. Load nf-core software module

    ```bash
    module load uppmax bioinfo-tools nf-core
    ```

6. Run `nf-core` to download the pipeline.

    ```bash
     nf-core pipelines download -c yes ampliseq

                                          ,--./,-.
          ___     __   __   __   ___     /,-._.--~\ 
    |\ | |__  __ /  ` /  \ |__) |__         }  {
    | \| |       \__, \__/ |  \ |___     \`-._,-`-,
                                          `._,._,'

    nf-core/tools version 3.0.2 - https://nf-co.re

    WARNING  Could not find GitHub authentication token. Some API requests may fail.
    ? Select release / branch: 2.11.0  [release]

    In addition to the pipeline code, this tool can download software containers.
    ? Download software container images: singularity

    Nextflow and nf-core can use an environment variable called $NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR that is a path to a directory where remote 
    Singularity images are stored. This allows downloaded images to be cached in a central location.
    
    ? Define $NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR for a shared Singularity image download folder? [y/n]: n

    If transferring the downloaded files to another system, it can be convenient to have everything compressed in a single file.
    This is not recommended when downloading Singularity images, as it can take a long time and saves very little space.
    ? Choose compression type: none

7. Running on Bianca

    ```bash
    module load bioinfo-tools Nextflow
    nextflow run ... -profile uppmax --project sens-XXXX-XX ....
    ```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD029 -->

Note: you might need `-c configs/conf/uppmax.config`,
make sure you have the file
(it is an option to download it during the pipeline download process).

## `nf-core` pipelines available offline on Bianca/Maya

UPPMAX does not maintain complete mirror anymore.
Only most requested pipelines are mirrored offline.
To check the available pipelines, run

```bash
tree -L 2 /sw/bioinfo/nf-core-pipelines/latest/rackham

...
├── rnaseq
│   ├── 1.0
│   ├── 1.1
│   ├── 1.2
│   ├── 1.3
...
```

To run a pipeline from the UPPMAX mirror, run

```bash
module load bioinfo-tools
module load nf-core-pipelines # this also loads Nextflow

nextflow run $NF_CORE_PIPELINES/pipeline_name/revision/workflow ...
```


## Common problems

- **Task is running out of resources (memory or time)**

Add lines to your configuration that overrides the settings for the problematic task, for example:

```python
process {
    withName: 'NFCORE_RNASEQ:RNASEQ:ALIGN_STAR:STAR_ALIGN' {
        cpus   = 12
        memory = '72.GB'
        time   = '24.h'
    }
}
```
