    **These commands are useful in the command line when something is stuck or a program is limiting you to do further work.**

    - ``ctrl-C`` interrupts a program or a command that is "stuck"
    - ``ctrl-D`` quits some programs from the program environment in the terminal
    - ``ctrl-Z`` pauses a program, can be continued in background (`bg`) or  foreground (`fg`)

See the [SSH X forwarding page](../software/ssh_x_forwarding.md) how to do so.

???- question "And what about Bianca?"

    Bianca is an UPPMAX cluster that does not allow [X forwarding](../software/ssh_x_forwarding.md).
