# Python `venv`

`venv` is one of multiple
[Python virtual environment managers](python_virtual_environments.md).

`venv` is a Python-only environment manager
and is [an official Python library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html),
with its own [official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

> The `venv` workflow

First, the common workflow for using a `venv` is described:

- how to [create a virtual environment](#create-a-virtual-environment)
- how to [activate a virtual environment](#activate-a-virtual-environment)
- how to [deactivate a virtual environment](#deactivate-a-virtual-environment)

Then:

- how to [export and import a virtual environment](#export-and-import-a-virtual-environment)

## Create a virtual environment

A virtual environment can be created in multiple ways,
for example, from scratch, which is not recommended.

Here we discuss the recommended way to create a virtual environment,
which has these steps:

1. Load a Python module or a modules with Python packages
1. Create the virtual environment

### 1. Load a Python module or a modules with Python packages

The first step is described at
['Loading Python'](../software/python.md#loading-python)
and
['Loading Python package modules'](../software/python.md#loading-python-package-modules).

???- question "Just show me how to do this"

    Sure, here is how to [load a Python module](../software/python.md#loading-python):

    ```bash
    module load python/3.11.8
    ```

    Here is how to [load a Python package module](../software/python.md#loading-python-package-modules):

    ```bash
    module load python_ML_packages/3.11.8-cpu
    ```

Because you can load Python modules of different Python versions,
you can create `venv` virtual environments with different Python versions.
Consider adding this in the `venv` name, e.g. `my_python2_venv` or `my_python3_venv`.

### 2. Create the virtual environment

After loading the needed Python modules,
one can create a virtual environment
most efficiently using:

```bash
python -m venv --system-site-packages [path]/[venv_name]
```

where `[path]` is the path where you want to create your `venv` virtual
environment and `[venv_name]` is the name of the `venv` virtual environment.
For example `python -m venv --system-site-packages ~/my_venvs/example_venv`.

!!! tip "Create virtual environments in your project storage"

    Virtual environments can take up a lot of disc space.

    If you use either (1) many `venv` virtual environments,
    or (2) install many Python packages to a `venv` virtual environment,
    we strongly recommend that you create the `venv`
    virtual environments in your project (`/proj/[your_uppmax_project]`) folder.

The `-m` flag makes sure that you use the libraries
from the Python version you are using.
The `--system-site-packages` flags ensure you use
the packages already installed in the
loaded Python module.

???- question "How long does this step take?"

    This depends.

    This takes around 10 seconds:

    ```bash
    module load python/3.11.8
    python -m venv --system-site-packages ~/my_venvs/example_venv
    ```

    This takes around 10 seconds:

    ```bash
    module load python_ML_packages/3.11.8-cpu
    python -m venv --system-site-packages ~/my_venvs/example_ml_venv
    ```

## Activate a virtual environment

To activate your newly created virtual environment locate the
script called `activate` and execute it:

```bash
source [path]/[venv_name]/bin/activate
```

where `[path]` is the path where you want to create your `venv` virtual
environment and `[venv_name]` is the name of the `venv` virtual environment.
For example `source ~/my_venvs/example_venv/bin/activate`.

When a `venv` virtual environment is active,
the prompt is changed to start with the name of your `venv`.

???- question "How does that look like?"

    This is how your changed prompt looks like:

    ```console
    [sven@rackham1 ~]$ module load python_ML_packages/3.11.8-cpu
    [sven@rackham1 ~]$ python -m venv --system-site-packages ~/my_venvs/example_venv
    [sven@rackham1 ~]$ source ~/my_venvs/example_venv/bin/activate
    (example_venv) [sven@rackham1 ~]$
    ```

With the `venv` virtual environment active,
you can now install and update Python packages
in an isolated way.

## Deactivate a virtual environment

To deactivate a `venv` virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

As the `venv` virtual environment you just used is now inactive,
the prompt will not show the name of your `venv` anymore.

You will need to [activate a virtual environment](#activate-a-virtual-environment)
to work with it again.

## Export and import a virtual environment

### Export

To export the Python packages used in your virtual environment, do:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This will create a file with all the Python packages and their versions,
using the conventional name for such a file.

???- question "How does that file look like?"

    This is how a `requirements.txt` file may look like:

    ```console
    anndata==0.10.5.post1
    anyio==4.2.0
    appdirs==1.4.4
    argon2-cffi==23.1.0
    argon2-cffi-bindings==21.2.0
    [more Python packages]
    websocket-client==1.7.0
    Werkzeug==3.0.1
    widgetsnbextension==4.0.9
    zipp==3.17.0
    zope.interface==6.1
    ```

    Note that `[more Python packages]` is a placeholder for many
    more Python packages.

### Import

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
