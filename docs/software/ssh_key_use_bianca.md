# Create an SSH key pair for use with Bianca

This page describes [how to create and use an SSH key](ssh_key_use.md)
for the [Bianca](../cluster_guides/bianca.md) cluster.

## Procedure

This procedure will fail if:

- You are outside of the university networks,
  see [how to get inside the university networks](../getting_started/get_inside_sunet.md).
  [This video](https://youtu.be/-f0C66zIrwI) shows it will fail when being
  outside of the university networks
- You use Ubuntu 24.04 Noble, as demonstrated by [this video](https://youtu.be/j6F8sJu2NFs),
  where a password is still requested after doing this procedure
  on Rackham

Here is the procedure:

### 1. Create an SSH key pair

On your local computer, create an SSH key pair with the following command:

???- question "Can I also do this from Rackham?"

    Yes.

    In that case, read 'Rackham' instead of 'local computer'

```bash
ssh-keygen -a 100 -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_uppmax_login -C "My comment"
```

Here is a description of the flags:

- `-a 100`:  100 rounds of key derivations, making your key's password harder to brute-force, as is recommended [here](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/144044)
- `-t ed25519`: type of encryption scheme
- `-f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_uppmax_login`: specify filename, following the naming scheme as suggested [here](https://superuser.com/a/1261644)
- `-C "My comment"`: a comment that will be stored in the key, so you can find out what it was for

### 2. Add the content of your public key to Bianca's authorized keys

Add the content of the public key `id_ed25519_uppmax_login.pub`
on your local computer to the Bianca's `$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

There are multiple ways to do so.

???- question "Can I use `ssh-copy`?"

    No.

    You can not use `ssh-copy`.

One way is to, on your local computer, view the content of the file:

```bash
cat $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519_uppmax_login.pub
```

Then copy that line to your clipboard.

???- question "How does that look like?"

    ```bash
    $ cat $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519_uppmax_login.pub
    ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIFGXV8fRK+cazt8qHX+fGS+w6WPOuE82Q19A12345678 Sven's key to UPPMAX
    ```

On Bianca, to edit the authorized keys file, do:

```bash
nano $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

In `nano`, paste the line in your clipboard.
Save the file and close `nano`.

!!! warning "The public key must be one line"

    The public key you've just copy-pasted must be one line.
    It must not be wrapped/split over multiple lines.

???- question "How can I check?"

    On Bianca, do:

    ```bash
    cat .ssh/authorized_keys 
    ```

    You should find your public key there. It looks similar to this:

    ```bash
    [sven@sens2017625-bianca ~]$ cat .ssh/authorized_keys 
    ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIFGXV8fRK+cazt8qHX+fGS+w6WPOuE82Q19A12345678 Sven's key to UPPMAX
    ```

### 3. Set the right permissions

On Bianca, do:

```
chmod 700 .ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 .ssh
chmod 700 ~
```

???- question "How can I check?"

    You can check by doing the following and observing similar output:

    ```bash
    ls -ld .ssh
    ```

    Output should be:

    ```text
    drwx--S--- 2 sven sven 4096 Jan  8 10:26 .ssh
    ```


    Second checkL

    ```bash
    [richel@sens2017625-bianca ~]$ ls -ld .ssh/authorized_keys 
    ```

    Output should be similar to:

    ```text
    -rwx------ 1 sven sven 104 Jan  8 10:26 .ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

    Third check:

    ```bash
    ls -l .ssh
    ```

    Output should be similar to:

    ```text
    total 1
    -rw-r----- 1 user user 743 May  7  2019 authorized_keys
    ```

    or

    ```text
    total 1
    -rwx------ 1 sven sven 104 Jan  8 10:26 authorized_keys
    ```

### 4. [Log in to Bianca via the console using an SSH key](../getting_started/login_bianca_console_ssh_key.md)

[Log in to Bianca via the console using an SSH key](../getting_started/login_bianca_console_ssh_key.md),
using `ssh -A`:

```bash
ssh -A [username]-[project]@bianca.uppmax.uu.se
```

For example:

```bash
ssh -A sven-sens12345@bianca.uppmax.uu.se
```

You will still get one login, which is the one that asks your UPPMAX
password and 2FA.

If all worked, there will be no need anymore to again type the UPPMAX
password.

## Troubleshooting

To debug, run SSH commands with the `-vv` flag.

???- question "How does that look like?"

    ```console
    ...
    debug1: Requesting authentication agent forwarding.
    debug2: channel 1: request auth-agent-req@openssh.com confirm 0
    ...

    debug1: client_input_channel_open: ctype auth-agent@openssh.com rchan 2 win 65536 max 16384
    debug1: client_request_agent: bound agent to hostkey
    debug2: fd 8 setting O_NONBLOCK
    debug1: channel 2: new [authentication agent connection]
    debug1: confirm auth-agent@openssh.com

### On Linux, it still asks for a password

From [this post](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/26371/ssh-prompts-for-password-despite-ssh-authorized-keys)
and [its answer](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/664213):

On Bianca, do:

```bash
chmod 700 .ssh/authorized_keys 
chmod 700 .ssh
chmod 700 ~
```

On your local computer, do:

```bash
chmod 700 .ssh/authorized_keys 
chmod 700 .ssh
chmod 700 ~
```
