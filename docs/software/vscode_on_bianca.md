# Using Visual Studio Code on Bianca

!!! warning "VSCode fails, use VSCodium instead"

    The approach below will fail
    (note that [using VSCode on Rackham](vscode_on_rackham.md) does work).

    Instead, go to the page [Using VSCodium on Bianca](vscodium_on_bianca.md)

## Introduction

There are multiple [IDEs on Bianca](../software/ides_on_bianca.md),
among other [VSCodium](../software/vscodium.md).
Here we discuss that running [VSCode](../software/vscode.md)
on [Bianca](../cluster_guides/bianca.md) will fail.

Visual Studio Code ('VSCode') is an [IDE](../software/ides.md)
that can be used for software development in many languages.

???- tip "What is an IDE?"

    See [the page on IDEs](../software/ides.md).

In this session, we show how to use VSCode on Bianca.
