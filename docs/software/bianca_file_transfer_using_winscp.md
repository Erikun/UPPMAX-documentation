WinSCP is a secure file transfer tool that works under Windows.

To transfer files to/from [Bianca](../cluster_guides/bianca.md) using WinSCP, do the following steps:

To transfer files to/from Bianca using FileZilla, do the following steps:

### 1. Get inside SUNET

[Get inside of SUNET](../getting_started/get_inside_sunet.md).

???- question "Forgot how to get within SUNET?"

    See [the 'get inside the university networks' page](../getting_started/get_inside_sunet.md)

### 2. Start WinSCP

Start WinSCP.

### 3. Create a new site

In WinSCP, click on 'Create new site'.

For that site, use all standards, except:

- Set file protocol to 'SFTP'
- Set host name to `bianca-sftp.uppmax.uu.se`
- Set user name to `[username]`, e.g. `sven`
- **Do not set password! Provide your UPPMAX password followed immediately by the UPPMAX 2FA  when asked by the interactive login.**

### 4. Click 'Connect'

In WinSCP, click 'Connect'

You will be asked for your password with two-factor identification, hence
type `[your password][2FA code]`, e.g. `VerySecret123456`.

Now you can transfer files between your local computer and [your `wharf` folder](../cluster_guides/wharf.md).
