# Data transfer to/from Pelle using Transit using SCP

!!! warning "Does not work yet"

    [Pelle](../cluster_guides/pelle.md) is a new UPPMAX HPC cluster
    that is in the process of being deployed.

    The procedure as described on this page does not work yet or is untested.

    This page will be updated when this works.

There are multiple ways to [transfer data to/from Pelle](../cluster_guides/transfer_pelle.md).

One can use SCP to copy files between Pelle and Transit,
from either Pelle or Transit.

Both ways are shown step-by-step below.
