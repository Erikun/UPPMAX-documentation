GNU nano is a simple [terminal](../software/terminal.md) text editor
that is easy to learn.

## Starting `nano`

Start `nano` on a terminal with:

```bash
nano
```

To start `nano` to edit a file (for example, `my_file.txt`, use:

```bash
nano my_file.txt
```

## Using `nano`

The keyboard shortcuts are shown on-screen,
where `^` denotes `Ctrl` and `M` the meta key.

OS specifics:

- On Windows, `Alt` is the meta key
- On Mac: in the `Terminal.app`, go to 'Preferences -> Settings -> Keyboard'
  and turn on "Use option as meta key", after which `Alt` is the meta key

Common tasks:

- Save a file: `CTRL + O` , then edit the filename and press enter
- Exit: `CTRL + X`, press "y" or "n" on some questions
  and/or press Enter to confirm.
- Help: `CTRL + G`
