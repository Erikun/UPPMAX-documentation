# IDEs on Pelle

Here we show how to use some [IDEs](../software/ides.md) on Pelle.

???- question "Forgot what an IDE is?"

    See [the general page about IDEs](../software/ides.md).

???- question "Do you really want to use an IDE on Pelle?"

    Using an IDE on Pelle is cumbersome and
    there are superior ways to develop code on Pelle.

    However, using an IDE may make it easier for a new user to feel
    comfortable using Pelle.

    The [UPPMAX 'Programming Formalisms' course](https://github.com/UPPMAX/programming_formalisms)
    will teach you a superior workflow,
    where development takes place on your own regular computer
    and testing is done using simulated/fake data.
    When development is done,
    the tested project is uploaded to Pelle and setup to
    use the real data instead.

    This avoids using a clumsy remote desktop environment,
    as well as many added bonuses.

Here are step-by-step guides to start these IDEs on Pelle:
