# RStudio on Rackham

![RStudio on Rackham](./img/rstudio_in_action_480_x_270.png)

## Introduction

RStudio is an IDE specialized for the R programming language.

???- tip "What is an IDE?"

    See [the page on IDEs](../software/ides.md).

In this session, we show how to use RStudio on Rackham,
using Rackham's remote desktop environment.

???- tip "Forgot how to login to a remote desktop environment?"

    See [the 'Logging in to Rackham' page](../getting_started/login_rackham.md).

    Spoiler: go to [https://rackham.uppmax.uu.se/](https://rackham.uppmax.uu.se/)

As RStudio is a resource-heavy program,
it must be run on an interactive node.

???- tip "Forgot how to start an interactive node?"

    See [the 'Starting an interactive node' page](../cluster_guides/start_interactive_node_on_rackham.md).

## Procedure to start RStudio

Below is a step-by-step procedure to start RStudio on Rackham.

??? question "Prefer a video?"

    This procedure is also demonstrated in [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/efSOFfBVBPQ).

### 1. Get within SUNET

This step is only needed when outside of Sweden.

???- question "Forgot how to get within SUNET?"

    See the 'get inside the university networks' page [here](../getting_started/get_inside_sunet.md)

### 2. Start the Rackham remote desktop environment

???- tip "Forgot how to start Rackham's remote desktop environment?"

    See [the 'Logging in to Rackham' page](../getting_started/login_rackham.md).

### 3. Start an interactive session

Within the Rackham remote desktop environment, start a [terminal](../software/terminal.md).
Within that terminal, start an interactive session with 2 cores.

!!!- info "Why two cores?"

    RStudio is a resource-heavy program.
    Due to this, we recommend using at least two cores
    for a more pleasant user experience.

???- tip "Forgot how to start an interactive node?"

    See [the 'Starting an interactive node' page](../cluster_guides/start_interactive_node_on_rackham.md).

    Spoiler: use:

    ```bash
    interactive -A sens2023598 -n 2 -t 8:00:00
    ```

!!!- warning "Do not start RStudio from the menus"

    You can start a version of RStudio from the menus.
    However, this will not have access to loaded modules.

    Instead, load RStudio from the module system instead.

### 4. Load the modules needed

In the terminal of the interactive session, do:

```bash
module load R/4.3.1 R_packages/4.3.1 RStudio/2023.12.1-402
```

???- question "How does that look like?"

    Your output will be similar to:

    ```bash
    [richel@r210 richel]$ module load R/4.3.1 R_packages/4.3.1 RStudio/2023.12.1-402
    R/4.3.1: Nearly all CRAN and BioConductor packages are installed and available by loading
    the module R_packages/4.3.1 
    R_packages/4.3.1: Note that loading some spatial analysis packages, especially geo-related packages, might
    R_packages/4.3.1: require you to load additional modules prior to use. monocle3 is such a package. See
    R_packages/4.3.1: 'module help R_packages/4.3.1'

    R_packages/4.3.1: The RStudio packages pane is disabled when loading this module, due to RStudio slowdowns
    R_packages/4.3.1: because there are >20000 available packages. *All packages are still available.*  For 
    R_packages/4.3.1: more information and instructions to re-enable the packages pane (not recommended) see
    R_packages/4.3.1: 'module help R_packages/4.3.1'

    RStudio/2023.12.1-402: Sandboxing is not enabled for RStudio at UPPMAX. See 'module help RStudio/2023.12.1-402' for more information
    ```

???- question "What happens if I do not load `R` or `R_packages`?"

    Then you will have the sytem-wide R version 3.6.0
    without any packages installed.

???- question "What does 'Sandboxing is not enabled for RStudio at UPPMAX' mean?"

    Nothing.

    Here is how it looks like:

    ```bash
    [sven@r482 richel]$ module load RStudio/2023.06.2-561
    RStudio/2023.06.2-561: Sandboxing is not enabled for RStudio at UPPMAX. See 'module help RStudio/2023.06.2-561' for more information
    [sven@r482 richel]$ module help RStudio/2023.06.2-561

    --------------------------------------------------- Module Specific Help for "RStudio/2023.06.2-561" ----------------------------------------------------
     RStudio - use RStudio 2023.06.2-561

     Version 2023.06.2-561

    With the Linux distribution used on most UPPMAX clusters (CentOS 7), RStudio/2023.06.2-561
    prefers to use a 'suid sandbox'. We do not enable this at UPPMAX. Instead, we disable sandboxing
    during startup of RStudio by defining a shell alias for the 'rstudio' command. You may notice
    additional errors in the terminal window from which you ran the 'rstudio' command. This is
    expected and does not affect RStudio operation.

    For performance reasons, UPPMAX disables checks for updates.

    UPPMAX also disables the 'Packages' pane of RStudio if an R_packages module is loaded.
    ```


### 5. Start RStudio

With the modules loaded, start RStudio from the terminal (on the
interactive node):

```bash
rstudio
```

RStudio can be slow to startup, as R has thousands (!) of packages.
Additionally, at startup and if enabled, your saved RStudio workspace
(with potentially a lot of data!) is read.
