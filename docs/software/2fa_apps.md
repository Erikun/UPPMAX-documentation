# 2FA apps

Assuming you use a smart phone, there are quite a number of good apps for
handling twofactor authentication.

A simple one that is easy to get going with is Google Authenticator.
It's available for Android and iOS.

Authy is another alternative that features cloud storage and sync between
devices but needs some initial setup.
Available for Android, iOS and as a Chrome App for computers.

Password handlers and security solutions also often feature two factor
handling, e.g. Lastpass and Duo Mobile.
